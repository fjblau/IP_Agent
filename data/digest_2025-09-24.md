It also says rapid growth in the outsourcing of veterans’ healthcare to private doctors “threatens to divert resources” from the VA’s high-quality direct care.
Collins has said he’s simply “giving veterans more choices for quality, timely healthcare, whether at VA facilities or with doctors in the community”.
Photograph: Supplied to the GuardianSeveral VA doctors who signed the letter, some of them veterans themselves, told the Guardian that’s a risk they’re willing to take.
But critics note it also cuts $12bn from the public veterans’ healthcare system while adding a 50% increase in funding for private medical services.
The VA doctors’ letter includes a five-page appendix linking to numerous academic studies and government audits, which show that the VA provides superior healthcare for veterans at a lower cost to taxpayers than private care.

### [‘What do you value more – kindness or intelligence?’ A trans couple’s hunt for the perfect sperm donor – one stranger at a time](https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2025/sep/25/trans-couple-hunt-perfect-sperm-donor-krishna-istha-live-show-first-trimester)
**Source:** The Guardian

For the London-based writer, performer and comedian Krishna Istha, a creative approach to finding a sperm donor came naturally – and resulted in a heartwarming and evocative show.
During a 10-minute interview, Istha connects with each person as an individual, rather than the clinical information sperm banks usually provide about donors.
The couple started looking into donor sperm properly four years ago, in the UK, Australia and Aotearoa (New Zealand) where Rea was born.
It’s worth noting that the number of sperm donors is relatively small, which also means it’s predominantly white.
(There’s even a Netflix documentary, Sperm Donors Wanted!, directed by Rea.)

### [The American system is badly broken | Bernie Sanders](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/sep/24/bernie-sanders-opinion-billionaire-politics)
**Source:** The Guardian

Let’s talk instead about the reality which the corporate-controlled media and the corporate-controlled political system don’t talk about very much.
In one America, the richest people are becoming obscenely richer and have never, ever had it so good.
That America is overflowing with unimaginable wealth, greed and opulence that makes the Gilded Age seem very modest.
In the first America, one man – Elon Musk, the richest man in the world, worth more than $480bn, owns more wealth than the bottom 52% of American households.
For most Americans, the system is not just broken, it is collapsing and is increasingly resembling life in the third world.

### [Tom Brady says critics of his role as NFL owner and broadcaster are ‘blinded by distrust’](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/24/tom-brady-fox-raiders-nfl)
**Source:** The Guardian

Tom Brady has said only the “paranoid and distrustful” doubt that he can work as both a broadcaster and team owner in the NFL.
Since he retired from playing, Brady has become a minority owner of the Las Vegas Raiders and taken up a role as an analyst with Fox.
As part of his broadcasting role, Brady has access to others teams’ players and coaches, an option unavailable to owners of other NFL teams.
Because when you’re blinded by distrust, it’s hard to see anything other than self-interest,” Brady wrote.
In the run-up to that game, Brady had access to coaches and players for the Bears, who the Raiders face this week.
