In July, Congress approved $9bn in cuts to aid and public broadcasting. Last month, the US president said he would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/29/trump-pocket-rescission-foreign-aid-funding\">be cancelling $4.9bn in aid</a> already approved by Congress.</p> <p>Kafulatira, where Banda lives, is a village of scattered mud huts with almost 1,000 people in Salima district, east of the capital, Lilongwe. There is no piped water or electricity, and a bridge across the steep-banked river that divides it from the nearest health centre was washed away last December.</p>    <p>A mobile clinic used to visit the community every month or so, providing a private space for women to get screening for cervical and other cancers, HIV tests and treatment, and vaccinations for children. It also provided antenatal checkups and family-planning services, including contraception.</p> <p>\u201cThe outreach clinics were helping a lot, because we could access services right here in the village,\u201d Mulirani Gerard says through a translator. \u201cSince last year, we had been waiting for the team to come, so we were just wondering what had happened.\u201d No one told villagers why their healthcare had been cut.</p> <p>Gerard says she has not been too badly affected, as she has a contraceptive implant that lasts for three years, but that others were not so lucky. \u201cIt\u2019s a challenge, because this has led to unintended pregnancies,\u201d the 25-year-old says, pointing to her friend Banda, as they sit in the shade with other mothers as children play around them.</p>    <p>Juliette Kannda, a 31-year-old mother of three, had been receiving bi-monthly contraceptive injections. Now, she says, she is saving up 10,000 kwacha for the 25-mile round trip to another health centre. \u201cI am looking forward to getting the [contraceptive] implant, considering the distances I travel to access services,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Malawi is one of the world\u2019s poorest countries. In 2024, the landlocked southern African country had an <a href=\"https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.CD?most_recent_value_desc=false\">income of just $508 per person</a>, according to the World Bank. It is incredibly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/23/water-malawai-drought-climate-crisis\">vulnerable to the climate crisis</a>: 80% of the population <a href=\"https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/malawi/overview\">work in agriculture</a> and it has been battered by repeated cyclones and droughts in recent years. The country, of about 22 million people, is also highly dependent on aid.</p> <p>Aid from the US, both grants and low-interest loans, amounted to 2% of the country\u2019s GDP in 2024, according to the <a href=\"https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/CR/Issues/2025/08/06/Malawi-2025-Article-IV-Consultation-Press-Release-Staff-Report-and-Statement-by-the-569391\">International Monetary Fund</a>. That compares with an average of 0.5% across sub-Saharan Africa.</p> <p>In 2023, the US accounted for a quarter of all aid sent to Malawi, according to the <a href=\"https://cgspace.cgiar.org/server/api/core/bitstreams/b1dcd9a0-31f4-4c20-b6c4-72cafbf42a0d/content\">International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI)</a>. The year before that, the Center for Global Development found that US health spending <a href=\"https://www.cgdev.org/blog/26-countries-are-most-vulnerable-us-global-health-aid-cuts-can-other-funders-bridge-gap\">was more than double that of the Malawian government</a>.</p>    <p>Malawi\u2019s economy was already in a parlous state before the US aid cuts. For the past three years, <a href=\"https://tradingeconomics.com/malawi/inflation-cpi\">inflation has been above 20%</a>, the economy has grown <a href=\"https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/malawi/overview\">more slowly than the population</a>, and a scarcity of foreign exchange has led to shortages of fuel, fertiliser and medicine. An <a href=\"https://cgspace.cgiar.org/server/api/core/bitstreams/b1dcd9a0-31f4-4c20-b6c4-72cafbf42a0d/content\">IFPRI study</a> in April estimated that US aid will fall 59% this year, cutting 1% off Malawi\u2019s GDP.</p> <p>The government had little means to make up the shortfall. Malawi\u2019s fiscal deficit (the gap between government expenditure and revenue) was 10.1% in the year to 31 March. In any case, its attempts to win back voters with election-year spending failed, with Lazarus Chakwera losing to Peter Mutharika in elections on September 16.</p> <p>Funding healthcare in Malawi \u201cis indeed the duty of the government, but \u2026 the government doesn\u2019t have the resources,\u201d says Hester Nyasulu, Malawi director for Amref Health Africa, a Kenyan organisation that was one of seven backing the Momentum Tikweze Umoyo project.</p> <p>The funding cuts should have been a \u201ctransitional process\u201d, he says, adding: \u201cWe were starting to reap the benefits of the investment \u2026 The termination of the USAID [funds] \u2026 will definitely lead to more deaths of pregnant and lactating women and also newborns.\u201d</p> <p>Between January 2022 and December 2024, maternal mortality rates in clinics and hospitals had fallen in three of the five districts covered by the project, according to data provided by Nyasulu. More children were vaccinated, treated for malaria and had their nutrition monitored, and more women received family planning services and first-trimester antenatal care, while <a href=\"https://www.phcp-journal.org/content/article/2/1/full/\">teenage pregnancies fell</a>.</p>    <p>In Salima district, outreach clinics were held at 87 sites surrounding seven health centres, reaching between three and 10 communities every weekday.

For the past three years, inflation has been above 20%, the economy has grown more slowly than the population, and a scarcity of foreign exchange has led to shortages of fuel, fertiliser and medicine. An IFPRI study in April estimated that US aid will fall 59% this year, cutting 1% off Malawi\u2019s GDP.\n\nThe government had little means to make up the shortfall.

We had made some strides in the TB fight in the district, but because of this I think we might be losing the battle.\u201d\n\nBefore the US aid cuts, 11,000 babies were immunised every month, says Maclean Nkhoma, the city\u2019s immunisation coordinator. Now it is less than 9,000, and the infant immunisation rate has fallen from 98% to 85%, he says.\n\n\u201cThey [the US] have been supporting us; they have to continue. Because otherwise whatever happens in Malawi or in Africa, like outbreaks, will also affect them,\u201d Nkhoma says. \u201cIf Africa is protected, that means the whole world is protected.\u201d",

Photograph: Dondi Tawatao/Getty Images\n\nRights groups believe up to 30,000 alleged drug users and dealers were slaughtered in the so-called drug war that wracked the Philippines after Rodrigo Duterte assumed power in 2016. Many of those killings, it is alleged, were at the hands of secretive police death squads.\n\nEight years on, Duterte is detained at The Hague, where he has been charged with crimes against humanity at the international criminal court (ICC) for allegedly orchestrating the campaign. But in Manila some police officers involved say their boozy, sleepless nights are over.\n\nThe Guardian interviewed four Philippine national police officers, including three former death squad members and one homicide detective, who were part of teams they claim killed about 400 people, including in senseless \u201cvendettas\u201d. As victims\u2019 families long for justice, the officers are largely unrepentant, and across the Philippines a deep affection for Duterte endures.\n\nAll the officers interviewed \u2013 two of whom have since retired \u2013 believe the killing spree was justified. \u201cBad people\u201d, they agreed, deserve to die.\n\nThe Philippine police did not respond to questions from the Guardian but a former police chief who oversaw the campaign previously described allegations of state-sanctioned death squads as \u201cfiction\u201d.\n\nDuterte\u2019s legal counsel at the ICC, Nick Kaufman, said court media policy prevented him from responding in detail to the allegations.\n\n\u201cAll I can say is that these recycled allegations are both thoroughly stale and vehemently denied,\u201d he said via email.\n\n\u201cDespite the attempts of a few obstinate politicians bent on destroying his legacy, Mr Duterte continues to enjoy huge support both at home and abroad. He served his country faithfully and with pride.\u201d\n\nDuterte admitted last year to keeping a \u201cdeath squad\u201d of \u201cgangsters\u201d in Davao \u2013 a model the ICC says he later nationalised \u2013 but denied as president to ordering police to conduct extrajudicial killings.\n\nView image in fullscreen Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency agents and police arrest an alleged drug dealer during a 2018 raid in Maharlika village, Taguig, south of Manila.

    "content": "<p>Any attempt by Israel to annex parts of the West Bank would be a red line for the US \u2013 and would represent the end of Arab-Israeli diplomatic normalisation, Emmanuel Macron said on Wednesday, claiming that he had been given that assurance by Donald Trump.</p> <p>Macron also revealed that he had presented the US leader with a three-page plan on the future of Palestine, based on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/12/un-general-assembly-to-back-hamas-free-government-for-palestine\">the New York Declaration</a>, the document endorsed by more than 143 states that proposes to exclude Hamas from future rule in Gaza and the West Bank.</p> <p>Speaking on France 24, Macron said the aim of his meeting with Trump on Tuesday had been to get America, Europe and the Arab states on the same page.</p> <p>Asked about Israeli plans <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/14/israel-appears-set-to-approve-controversial-settlement-of-3400-homes-in-west-bank\">to extend settlement in the West Bank</a> \u2013 including the E1 corridor that would involve the construction of 3,400 new homes \u2013 he said: \u201cOn that topic in very clear terms the Europeans and the Americans are on the same page.\u201d</p> <p>British officials have expressed concerns that Donald Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/23/british-officials-fear-donald-trump-could-recognise-israeli-west-bank-settlements\">could recognise Israeli sovereignty</a> over illegal settlements in the West Bank in retaliation for the UK, Australia, France and others deciding <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/21/uk-canada-and-australia-announce-formal-recognition-of-palestine-with-wave-of-israel-allies-to-follow\">to recognise Palestine</a>. Such a move would be a serious blow to any two-state solution.</p> <p>But Macron said that any attempt to annex the West Bank \u201cwould be the end of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/sep/15/uae-bahrain-and-israel-sign-historic-accords-at-white-house-event-formal-relations-trump-netanyahu\">the Abraham accords</a>, which was one of the success stories from Trump\u2019s first administration. The United Arab Emirates were very clear on it.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cI think it is a red line for the USA.\u201d</p> <p>Macron\u2019s comments provided the clearest insight yet on the behind-the-scenes diplomacy on plans for a \u201cday after\u201d the Gaza conflict.</p> <p>The signing of the 2020 Abraham accords, which normalised relations between Israel and a group of Arab states including the UAE, is prized by Trump as one of the crowning diplomatic achievements of his first term in office.</p> <p>If Trump does indeed insist that annexation must not happen, Israel\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, will be put in serious political difficulty, as parts of his extreme-right governmental coalition have demanded that Israel seize the West Bank either partly or completely.</p>    <p>On the other hand, if Netanyahu went ahead with annexation \u2013 with US endorsement or quiescence \u2013 the plan for a two-state solution in which a Palestinian state sits alongside Israel would be in serious jeopardy. Netanyahu is due to meet Trump at the White House on Monday and will address the UN general assembly on Friday.</p> <p>Macron said the initial goal in his \u201cbrand new\u201d multi-stage plan was to secure a ceasefire and the release of all the hostages.</p> <p>He said he had appealed directly to Trump at their meeting, saying: \u201cYou have a major role to play and you want to see peace in the world.\u201d</p> <p>He said: \u201cWe have to convince the Americans to put pressure on Israel\u201d as the US is \u201cthe country with real leverage\u201d.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s special envoy Steve Witkoff also said the US president had presented regional Arab and Muslim leaders with a 21-point plan for peace in the Middle East at a meeting on Tuesday. Speaking at an event on the sidelines of the UN general assembly, he said: \u201cWe\u2019re hopeful \u2013 and I might say even confident \u2013 that in the coming days we\u2019ll be able to announce some sort of breakthrough.\u201d</p> <p>Macron said that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/22/arab-and-muslim-leaders-to-meet-trump-to-discuss-peace-plan-for-gaza\">French recognition of the state of Palestine</a> had been intended to open up a peace process, which he said was the best route to isolating Hamas. The goal was to demilitarise and break up the militant group, he said.</p> <p>But he suggested that some rightwing members of the Israeli cabinet were more intent on spoiling any political settlement. \u201cThe objective of some is not to fight Hamas but rather to undermine the possibility of a path to peace,\u201d he said. He added: \u201cThere is no Hamas in the West Bank.\u201d</p> <p>He stressed that Netanyahu\u2019s strategy of total war was a failure since it only endangered the hostages and has failed to reduce the size of the Hamas military. \u201cThere are just as many Hamas fighters as before. Total war from a practical point of view is not working. This war is a failure.\u201d</p> <p>Macron said the fate of hostages and Gaza\u2019s civilian population should not be \u201cleft in the hands of those for whom the release of hostages is not a priority\u201d. He added: \u201cNetanyahu\u2019s first priority is not the release of hostages \u2013 otherwise he would not have launched the latest offensive on Gaza City, nor would he have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/09/israel-targets-top-hamas-members-in-qatar-for-gaza-ceasefire-talks\">struck negotiators in Qatar</a>.\u201d</p> <p>He insisted that as part of the plan for the future governance of Gaza and the West Bank, Hamas would be removed and a Palestinian Authority with new commitments to reform would eventually take charge.

    "full_text": "Any attempt by Israel to annex parts of the West Bank would be a red line for the US \u2013 and would represent the end of Arab-Israeli diplomatic normalisation, Emmanuel Macron said on Wednesday, claiming that he had been given that assurance by Donald Trump.\n\nMacron also revealed that he had presented the US leader with a three-page plan on the future of Palestine, based on the New York Declaration, the document endorsed by more than 143 states that proposes to exclude Hamas from future rule in Gaza and the West Bank.\n\nSpeaking on France 24, Macron said the aim of his meeting with Trump on Tuesday had been to get America, Europe and the Arab states on the same page.\n\nAsked about Israeli plans to extend settlement in the West Bank \u2013 including the E1 corridor that would involve the construction of 3,400 new homes \u2013 he said: \u201cOn that topic in very clear terms the Europeans and the Americans are on the same page.\u201d\n\nBritish officials have expressed concerns that Donald Trump could recognise Israeli sovereignty over illegal settlements in the West Bank in retaliation for the UK, Australia, France and others deciding to recognise Palestine. Such a move would be a serious blow to any two-state solution.\n\nBut Macron said that any attempt to annex the West Bank \u201cwould be the end of the Abraham accords, which was one of the success stories from Trump\u2019s first administration. The United Arab Emirates were very clear on it.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cI think it is a red line for the USA.\u201d\n\nMacron\u2019s comments provided the clearest insight yet on the behind-the-scenes diplomacy on plans for a \u201cday after\u201d the Gaza conflict.\n\nThe signing of the 2020 Abraham accords, which normalised relations between Israel and a group of Arab states including the UAE, is prized by Trump as one of the crowning diplomatic achievements of his first term in office.\n\nIf Trump does indeed insist that annexation must not happen, Israel\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, will be put in serious political difficulty, as parts of his extreme-right governmental coalition have demanded that Israel seize the West Bank either partly or completely.\n\nView image in fullscreen Macron said he had appealed to Trump directly, telling him: \u2018You have a major role to play and you want to see peace in the world.\u2019 Photograph: Ludovic Marin/AFP/Getty Images\n\nOn the other hand, if Netanyahu went ahead with annexation \u2013 with US endorsement or quiescence \u2013 the plan for a two-state solution in which a Palestinian state sits alongside Israel would be in serious jeopardy. Netanyahu is due to meet Trump at the White House on Monday and will address the UN general assembly on Friday.\n\nMacron said the initial goal in his \u201cbrand new\u201d multi-stage plan was to secure a ceasefire and the release of all the hostages.\n\nHe said he had appealed directly to Trump at their meeting, saying: \u201cYou have a major role to play and you want to see peace in the world.\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201cWe have to convince the Americans to put pressure on Israel\u201d as the US is \u201cthe country with real leverage\u201d.\n\nTrump\u2019s special envoy Steve Witkoff also said the US president had presented regional Arab and Muslim leaders with a 21-point plan for peace in the Middle East at a meeting on Tuesday. Speaking at an event on the sidelines of the UN general assembly, he said: \u201cWe\u2019re hopeful \u2013 and I might say even confident \u2013 that in the coming days we\u2019ll be able to announce some sort of breakthrough.\u201d\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to First Thing Free daily newsletter Our US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it matters Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The goal was to demilitarise and break up the militant group, he said.\n\nBut he suggested that some rightwing members of the Israeli cabinet were more intent on spoiling any political settlement. \u201cThe objective of some is not to fight Hamas but rather to undermine the possibility of a path to peace,\u201d he said. He added: \u201cThere is no Hamas in the West Bank.\u201d\n\nHe stressed that Netanyahu\u2019s strategy of total war was a failure since it only endangered the hostages and has failed to reduce the size of the Hamas military. \u201cThere are just as many Hamas fighters as before. Total war from a practical point of view is not working. This war is a failure.\u201d\n\nMacron said the fate of hostages and Gaza\u2019s civilian population should not be \u201cleft in the hands of those for whom the release of hostages is not a priority\u201d. He added: \u201cNetanyahu\u2019s first priority is not the release of hostages \u2013 otherwise he would not have launched the latest offensive on Gaza City, nor would he have struck negotiators in Qatar.\u201d\n\nHe insisted that as part of the plan for the future governance of Gaza and the West Bank, Hamas would be removed and a Palestinian Authority with new commitments to reform would eventually take charge. He gave no timescale.\n\nHe warned if there was a failure to bring an end to the fighting in the coming days, Europe would have to consider what other steps it would take; asked if that meant sanctions, he replied: \u201cObviously.\u201d\n\nAsked if there was ever going to be a majority for sanctions in the European Union, he said he was trying to change that, adding each country had its own history and sensitivity \u2013 a reference to Germany, which along with Italy has resisted sanctions.\n\nArguing that Palestinians had to be offered a political perspective for their future, Macron said the core of his argument was that \u201cif you don\u2019t give a group of people a political way out for their own legitimate existence when the international community recognised that 78 years ago, you are going to lead them to a complete loss of hope \u2013 or even worse violence.\u201d",

Kirk\u2019s podcast, The Charlie Kirk Show, now No 1 on the podcast charts, has had a rotating cast of hosts including Tucker Carlson, Glenn Beck and JD Vance, who used his appearance to announce a crackdown on \u201cfar-left\u201d groups, promising to \u201cdismantle\u201d them in Kirk\u2019s name.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2025/mar/19/beyond-andrew-tate-the-imitators-who-help-promote-misogyny-online\">\u201cManosphere\u201d</a> mainstay Joe Rogan was initially quiet on the Kirk shooting, releasing prerecorded episodes while he was away elk hunting. On Tuesday he began <a href=\"https://x.com/triffic_stuff_/status/1970591314103136590\">challenging the official narrative of the killing</a>, but has been more focused on the practicalities of the weapon used and the getaway than exploring the motivations of the killer, perhaps because Kirk was too much of an explicit rightwing partisan to chime with Rogan\u2019s libertarianism.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2025/sep/20/charlie-kirk-debate-style\">The students who debated with Charlie Kirk: \u2018His goal was to verbally defeat us\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>With Rogan steering clear of Kirk\u2019s politics, other rightwing figures in the podcast space are pushing their own narratives and conspiracy theories about Kirk\u2019s death and shooting up the podcast charts as they do so \u2013 chief among them Candace Owens, who is now No 2 on Spotify\u2019s trending podcast chart, just behind Kirk\u2019s podcast.</p> <p>Owens has spent the past week using her podcast to cast doubt that Kirk\u2019s killing was the action of a sole shooter. (Tyler Robinson, 22, is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/16/charlie-kirk-shooter-charged\">facing charges of aggravated murder</a> and felony discharge of a firearm, among others, in the death of Kirk.) This week she published podcasts titled: \u201cCharlie Kirk Suspect Charged. Something Isn\u2019t Right\u2026\u201d, \u201cWho Ordered the Hit on Charlie Kirk?\u201d and \u201cThey Are Lying About Charlie Kirk.\u201d</p> <p>But Owens is not convinced by the Donald Trump-led conspiracy that the organised left is to be blamed for Kirk\u2019s killing. Instead, she is pushing an alternate theory that Kirk\u2019s death is part of a large global conspiracy with Israel at the centre. She is not alone in believing there is an Israeli plot behind Kirk\u2019s murder \u2013 a number of far-right influencers <a href=\"https://www.adl.org/resources/article/antisemitic-and-anti-israel-conspiracy-theories-follow-fatal-shooting-charlie\">including Ian Carroll and Jackson Hinkle</a> have suggested that Israel may have played a role, so much so that Benjamin Netanyahu has issued two separate denials of his involvement.</p>    <p>To understand her conspiracy, you have to be very acquainted with a network of rightwing groups and podcasts that all reference each other. Essentially Owens believes that Kirk was wavering on his support for Israel, and had invited Carlson and Dave Smith \u2013 rightwingers who do not support the war in Gaza, to Turning Point USA events, where they took to the lectern to challenge the war and the influence of Israeli funding on US politics. She claimed Kirk told her that he was being threatened by the Israeli government and by Bill Ackman \u2013 the pro-Israel, pro-Trump hedge fund manager.</p> <p>Owens provides no conclusive evidence about these threats, instead leveraging her close friendship with Kirk to suggest she understands a deeper truth about the threats he was facing. In 2017, Kirk hired Owens at Turning Point USA as a \u201cdirector of urban engagement\u201d, after claims the rightwing organization had issues with racism. Owens was forced to resign from the group in 2019 (after saying Adolf Hitler would have been \u201cfine\u201d if he had focused on domestic politics) but the pair remained close; this week she described him as a \u201cbrother\u201d. Her podcasts on his killing feel pained and unrestrained \u2013 as you might expect from someone who had just seen their friend assassinated.</p> <p>Owens is careful not say that Israel killed Kirk \u2013 but she uses implication and association to keep alive the idea that Netanyahu may be involved: \u201cI\u2019m not trying to mutter darkly or imply anything \u2026 but I think it\u2019s important to say that out loud because it\u2019s a fact, and there are many liars out there trying, Bibi Netanyahu No 1 among them, shamefully, who are trying to distort the truth, a truth that I know and can prove,\u201d she said.</p> <p>These allegations are being taken seriously enough to have warranted rebuttals from Ackman and Netanyahu. Ackman posted cordial text messages between himself and Kirk as evidence that he never threatened him, adding: \u201cat no time have I ever threatened Charlie Kirk, Turning Point or anyone associated with him.\u201d Netanyahu has made two separate statements denying the \u201cinsane\u201d, \u201cfalse\u201d and \u201coutrageous\u201d rumors that Israel was involved in Kirk\u2019s death.</p> <p>Much of Owens\u2019 theorizing repeats a mix of anti-Zionist and antisemitic sentiment. In her podcasts, she talks about the \u201cZionist-controlled publications\u201d, that \u201cJoseph Goebbels has nothing on the Zionists in America and the propaganda that they have pushed\u201d and that Sigmund Freud, not Goebbels, is the \u201creal father of modern propaganda\u201d. Others are going further, including Carroll, the podcaster who is telling his 1.3 million followers on X that he thinks Israel is responsible for the death of Kirk. Carroll has previously been a guest on Owens\u2019 and Rogan\u2019s shows.</p>    <p>At Kirk\u2019s funeral, Carlson more subtly invoked the idea of Jewish involvement. He compared Kirk\u2019s death to the death of Jesus, which he blamed on \u201ca bunch of guys sitting around eating hummus, thinking about: \u2018What do we do about this guy telling the truth about us? We must make him stop talking.\u2019\u201d He was widely condemned by Jewish groups for doing so, including by a rabbi in Kirk\u2019s home state of Arizona, who called it \u201c<a href=\"https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/glendale/2025/09/23/tucker-carlson-eulogy-charlie-kirk-arizona-jewish-leaders-reaction/86300949007/\">bigoted blood libel</a>\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cCarlson is very polished in that sense,\u201d says Derek Beres, co-host of the Conspirituality podcast and expert in conspiracies and media literacy. \u201cHe\u2019ll say the thing without saying the thing so he gets an out.

I don\u2019t trust any of that information, there\u2019s no reason to. Between Trump\u2019s ear and this kid coming out of nowhere, I can\u2019t say I\u2019m 100% certain there isn\u2019t something going on. When you\u2019re in an accelerationist, shock-doctrine environment, the whole point is you can\u2019t really trust any of the information coming out.\u201d",

There\u2019s something else new in the EU\u2019s only one-party state: politics has returned.\n\nFor 15 years, Viktor Orb\u00e1n\u2019s electoral victories have been a foregone conclusion. But a credible political challenger to Orb\u00e1n has appeared. P\u00e9ter Magyar is no messiah: in fact, he is a defector from the ruling Fidesz party. But polls show Magyar and his new-ish pro-western Tisza movement are on course to defeat Orb\u00e1n in April elections.\n\nSuch an outcome would not just be a big deal for Hungarians.

Democracy Noir, a new Connie Field documentary about Orb\u00e1n, is being talked about as essential viewing for Americans because of the parallels it highlights between the Trump and Orb\u00e1n methods.\n\nRepackaged Maga ideology is now boosting Europe\u2019s insurgent parties on the populist right, in a remarkable feedback loop. Andrej Babi\u0161, an ally of both Orb\u00e1n and Marine Le Pen in France, is tipped for a return to power in the Czech Republic next month. Poland recently elected a nationalist president.

    "content": "<p>Garden tools have it rough, there\u2019s no getting around it. Dragged through the mud, blunted by branches, clogged with clippings and exposed to some of the most wearing of environmental conditions \u2013 namely rain, sap and soil \u2013 you can\u2019t help but feel the average spanner gets an easier ride than a pair of secateurs.</p> <p>And yet gardening tools are among the most cherished and expensive of maintenance equipment, with popular brands such as <a href=\"https://www.niwaki.com/\">Niwaki</a> and <a href=\"https://www.felco.com/\">Felco</a> catering to a booming luxury market with embellished components such as leather and rattan handles, and blades forged in the mountains of Yamagata, Japan.</p> <p>An estimated 27 million people are now actively gardening in the UK, and households are spending more on gardening tools than ever. And as I wrote in my roundup of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/apr/11/best-secateurs-bypass-uk\">the best secateurs</a> this year, such is the bond between gardener and trusty hand tool that they often become companionable, personally prized possessions. So what can you do to prolong the life of a treasured border spade, hedge trimmer or pair of beloved secateurs? Here are a few tried and tested tips from the hard-grafting experts, and some products that will make light work of a messy job.</p> <p>***</p> <h2><strong>How to make your garden tools last longer</strong></h2> <p>***</p> <h2><strong>Cultivation tools</strong></h2> <p>Having worked and volunteered in numerous large-team gardens over the years, I\u2019m always intrigued by the policies head gardeners employ for the preservation and storage of general-use gardening tools. While some are content with a quick brush down after use, others are positively draconian.</p> <p>Millie Souter, head gardener at the Plant Library in Hertfordshire, tells me she\u2019s strict about maintenance. Tools such as border spades and trowels are washed and rinsed clean under a hose after every use, and each has a designated space marked out in the potting shed. \u201cIt just makes it a pleasure to be able to grab a tool that\u2019s clean, ready to use, and you know where it is!\u201d she says.

Dragged through the mud, blunted by branches, clogged with clippings and exposed to some of the most wearing of environmental conditions \u2013 namely rain, sap and soil \u2013 you can\u2019t help but feel the average spanner gets an easier ride than a pair of secateurs.\n\nThe Guardian\u2019s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link. Learn more.\n\nAnd yet gardening tools are among the most cherished and expensive of maintenance equipment, with popular brands such as Niwaki and Felco catering to a booming luxury market with embellished components such as leather and rattan handles, and blades forged in the mountains of Yamagata, Japan.\n\nAn estimated 27 million people are now actively gardening in the UK, and households are spending more on gardening tools than ever. And as I wrote in my roundup of the best secateurs this year, such is the bond between gardener and trusty hand tool that they often become companionable, personally prized possessions. So what can you do to prolong the life of a treasured border spade, hedge trimmer or pair of beloved secateurs? Here are a few tried and tested tips from the hard-grafting experts, and some products that will make light work of a messy job.\n\nHaving worked and volunteered in numerous large-team gardens over the years, I\u2019m always intrigued by the policies head gardeners employ for the preservation and storage of general-use gardening tools. While some are content with a quick brush down after use, others are positively draconian.\n\nMillie Souter, head gardener at the Plant Library in Hertfordshire, tells me she\u2019s strict about maintenance. Tools such as border spades and trowels are washed and rinsed clean under a hose after every use, and each has a designated space marked out in the potting shed. \u201cIt just makes it a pleasure to be able to grab a tool that\u2019s clean, ready to use, and you know where it is!\u201d she says.

Photograph: AP\n\nMultiple districts in Hong Kong experienced flooding, according to images circulated on social media and verified by AFP.\n\nAt the Fullerton Ocean Park hotel, next to a theme park, a man was seen losing his balance after a storm surge shattered the glass front doors and swept into the hotel lobby, one of the videos showed.\n\nA spokesperson for the hotel said they were \u201cdoing all we can to mitigate the impact brought about by the super typhoon\u201d.\n\n0:46 Footage purports to show floodwater smashing through hotel lobby in Hong Kong \u2013 video\n\nFlood waters rushed into the seaside Heng Fa Chuen residential estate and covered its interior courtyards, another video clip showed.\n\nStrong winds ripped off the top of a pedestrian footbridge, while many of the city\u2019s tall buildings swayed and rattled in the harsh winds.\n\nAn off-duty firefighter, Tse, said he was \u201ca bit worried\u201d about the safety of nearby bamboo scaffoldings as he walked home after an 11-hour shift of \u201cnon-stop\u201d work.\n\nBenjamin Phizacklea, a 27-year-old chef, said: \u201cThis one was forecast to be quite bad so we were expecting a bit of chaos \u2026 but everywhere seems to be functioning quite efficiently still.\u201d\n\nThe rail operator MTR said train services on open sections were suspended, with limited service available on the underground sections.\n\nAuthorities said more than 760 people sought refuge at the 50 temporary shelters across Hong Kong.\n\nThe city\u2019s airport operator said only a limited number of cargo flights were scheduled for Wednesday, with its website listing hundreds of cancelled passenger flights.\n\nA five-year-old boy and his mother fell into the sea on Tuesday afternoon while they were watching the waves in the Chai Wan district, police said. Both were in critical condition in hospital. The boy\u2019s father, who reportedly jumped into the water to save his family, was also treated in hospital.\n\nView image in fullscreen Heavy waves in Hong Kong\u2019s Heng Fa Chuen residential district as Super Typhoon Ragasa approaches.

Like Emma Watson, she decided to simply slip out of Hollywood unannounced to enjoy her life away from the grind. Similarly, Jamie Foxx\u2019s career also looked like it had come to an end, after a stroke in 2023 left him gravely ill. However, this year the pair of them reunited for a film called \u2013 what else? \u2013 Back in Action, the Heard Ya Missed Me, Well I\u2019m Back of perfectly adequate Netflix action comedies. Well played.\n\nRule six: actually retire\n\nBelieve it or not, but this does actually happen. People just stop making films forever, and seem entirely happy about it. After making The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen in 2003 (and griping to the press that he was \u201cfed up with the idiots\u201d), Sean Connery enjoyed 17 years of retirement before he died in 2020. Robert Redford\u2019s last starring vehicle was The Old Man & The Gun, made seven years before his death. It has now been 15 years since Jack Nicholson last appeared on film, and it\u2019s unlikely that it will happen again. Sometimes, like Emma Watson, the most dignified thing is to walk away for good.",
    "summary": "In a recent interview with Hollywood Authentic, Emma Watson described herself as \u201cthe happiest and healthiest I\u2019ve ever been\u201d.\nThe risk, however, is that now Daniel Day-Lewis looks a bit silly.\nBy underlining that this is a pause rather than a full-stop, Swinton gets all the attention that Daniel Day-Lewis did, but won\u2019t have to make such a public back-down.\nLike Emma Watson, she decided to simply slip out of Hollywood unannounced to enjoy her life away from the grind.\nSometimes, like Emma Watson, the most dignified thing is to walk away for good.",

    "description": "Marc Elias has long defended high-profile Democrats and election law, resisting Trump\u2019s crackdown on his opponents",
    "content": "<p>Marc Elias, a prominent Democratic election attorney, has not shied away from standing up to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration\">Trump administration</a>, and has been targeted for retribution this year multiple times as a result.</p> <p>He\u2019s one of scores of lawyers the Trump administration has named in executive actions, joining a list that includes big law firms and attorneys who worked for people Donald Trump considers his opponents.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/23/ice-deportation-us-mexico-farm-worker\">Ice targeted me for organizing, says farm worker who left US for Mexico</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There\u2019s no shortage of reasons why the president would hate Elias and want to shut him down: Elias has for decades represented high-profile Democrats, including the presidential campaigns of Hillary Clinton and Kamala Harris, and prominent liberal groups, including the Democratic national committee (DNC). He hired the research group that investigated Trump\u2019s ties to Russia in 2016, eventually becoming the Steele dossier. He specializes in election law and won 64 of the 65 cases he worked on in response to Trump\u2019s efforts to overturn the 2020 election results.</p> <p>In <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/preventing-abuses-of-the-legal-system-and-the-federal-court/\">one presidential memo</a>, the Trump administration listed \u201cexamples of grossly unethical misconduct\u201d by lawyers, singling out Elias for his involvement in the Steele dossier. The law firm Elias used to work for, Perkins Coie, <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/addressing-risks-from-perkins-coie-llp/\">got its own presidential action</a> that cited the dossier. Trump <a href=\"https://x.com/atrupar/status/1900634874114957444\">mentioned</a> Elias by name in March at a Department of Justice press conference, calling him a \u201cradical\u201d who was trying to \u201cturn America into a corrupt, communist and third-world country\u201d.</p> <p>While a long list of big-name law firms have capitulated to Trump\u2019s demands, Elias says his firm was built to withstand the pressure and its important to him to use his platform to fight back, though his outspokenness often comes with pushback.</p> <p>The presidential memo, which names Elias as an example of an attorney to target, directed the attorney general to \u201ctake all appropriate action to refer for disciplinary action\u201d any attorney that violated ethical guidelines and to \u201creview conduct by attorneys or their law firms in litigation against the Federal Government over the last 8 years\u201d.</p> <p>Elias isn\u2019t aware he\u2019s under investigation, but said he thinks people not taking Trump literally is \u201cone of the great failings\u201d of his time in power.</p> <p>\u201cEvery day we wake up and we see another vindictive act by this administration against its political opponents, whether they be in elective office or be in the private sector,\u201d he said. \u201cI think anyone who uses their voice to speak up against Donald Trump needs to be realistic about the nature of this administration and the threats it poses.\u201d</p> <p>He didn\u2019t escape scrutiny during Trump\u2019s first term. He first came up on Trump\u2019s radar, to his knowledge, when the president <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/who-marc-elias-trump-election-stealing-1209671\">called</a> him the Democrats\u2019 \u201cbest Election stealing lawyer\u201d after Elias went to work on a close Senate election in Florida in 2018.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s second term, though, is like \u201cday and night\u201d from his first, Elias said. The president is now \u201csingle-mindedly focused on going after his political opponents\u201d and any walls between Trump and the Department of Justice have crumbled.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a very different thing when he is not just unleashing the hordes of hate on social media, not just activating the rightwing echo chamber, but is talking to people who are in positions of power to actually do something about his obsessions,\u201d Elias said.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Anyone who tells you that Donald Trump targets them and they don\u2019t care, I think they\u2019re just lying to you</p> <footer> <cite>Marc Elias</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Despite not posting on X anymore \u2013 his decision to stop using the platform prompted conspiracy theories from the right <strong>\u2013</strong> he is far from quiet about his work and his opinions on the Trump administration. He posts often on other platforms, runs a democracy-focused outlet and files lawsuits against the Trump administration on the regular.</p> <p>\u201cEvery day we wake up and we see another vindictive act by this administration against its political opponents, whether they be in elective office or be in the private sector,\u201d he said. \u201cI think anyone who uses their voice to speak up against Donald Trump needs to be realistic about the nature of this administration and the threats it poses.\u201d</p> <p>In response to questions about why the administration has targeted Elias, Davis Ingle, a spokesman for the White House, said Elias \u201cis a crooked hack who was deeply involved in creating a false \u2018dossier\u2019 against President Trump on behalf of his crooked client Hillary Clinton, in order to sway the 2016 election in her favor. Marc Elias is a disgraceful swamp creature and President Trump is draining that swamp.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Elias, Democratic superlawyer</strong></h2> <p>A lifelong Democrat, Elias helped build up election law to what it is today. When he was a young lawyer, it was a rare specialty \u2013 election disputes were typically seen as political issues, not legal ones. Now, post-election disputes are almost entirely legal issues.</p> <p>A 2008 Senate race in Minnesota in which Democrat Al Franken eventually won over Republican Norm Coleman turned the tide. Elias served as Franken\u2019s counsel in what became the longest recount in US history. At the time, some in his party said Franken should concede since Democrats had a strong majority in the Senate and Barack Obama had just won the White House. Elias is always on \u201cteam fight\u201d, he said, because \u201cas long as there is a legal fight to be had, we are going to have it\u201d.</p> <p>Some have <a href=\"https://electionlawblog.org/?p=127270\">opined</a> that his fighting posture can be counterproductive to voting rights, especially with the courts growing more conservative, because the cases can create bad precedent. He has argued for increased coordination between outside political action committees and political parties, a move that <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/30/us/politics/democratic-lawyer-stymied-trump-in-2020-other-efforts-played-into-gop-hands.html\">Trump capitalized on</a> for his ground game in 2024. In 2023, Joe Biden parted ways with Elias, with <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2023/07/31/biden-marc-elias-democrats-election-lawsuits\">sources saying</a> at the time that Biden\u2019s team had frustrations and discomfort with Elias\u2019s hard charging and big legal bills. That year, he also <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-democratic-national-committee-lawyer-elias-part-ways-2023-04-12/\">stopped</a> representing the DNC.</p> <p>\u201cThere was a time where there were people who would say: \u2018Marc is too quick to litigate, and you can make bad law.\u2019 And I would say then, and I would certainly say now, what are you saving these laws for, if it is not for this moment? \u2026 We are in the break-glass moment of American history when it comes to free and fair elections and democracy and so, no, I don\u2019t have any hesitation about litigating everything that we possibly can to protect elections.\u201d</p> <p>He worked at Perkins Coie until 2021, heading up its political law work and counting a host of big-name Democratic groups and elected officials as his clients. He started his own firm, Elias Law Group, after that, and Democracy Docket, which documents attacks on democracy.</p> <p>The firm is built to \u201cwithstand the pressures of Donald Trump\u201d and only takes on clients from Democratic campaigns, the party itself, clients associated with Democratic politics or groups advancing voting rights on a nonpartisan basis. It does not take on corporate clients or clients with government contracts. That stance is part of why Elias thinks his firm itself hasn\u2019t been targeted in a Trump executive action. There are fewer ways to pressure him.</p> <p>Elias was initially surprised at the executive orders targeting law firms because he thought the firms would fight back and win, and Trump would look foolish in the process. He didn\u2019t count on the \u201ccowardice\u201d of firms that instead struck up settlements with Trump, capitulating to the president\u2019s demands by dropping cases and giving massive amounts of pro bono work to conservative causes. The firms that did fight back, including Perkins Coie, have won, but it\u2019s hard to argue Trump didn\u2019t achieve his goals by going after lawyers, he said.</p> <p>\u201cI think he thought, if I can prevent big law from being that role, that\u2019ll make it easier for me to run roughshod over people\u2019s rights. And he\u2019s not wrong about that,\u201d Elias said. \u201cHe has actually intimidated a lot of law firms, I think, from taking on causes that they otherwise would have taken on.\u201d</p> <p>When CBS\u2019s 60 Minutes <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-orders-target-law-firms-some-lawyers-say-that-threatens-rule-of-law-60-minutes-transcript/\">covered</a> the crackdown on lawyers in May, host Scott Pelley noted that \u201cit was nearly impossible to get anyone on camera for this story because of the fear now running through our system of justice\u201d. Elias sat for an interview.</p> <p>Elias has grappled with whether and how to speak up. Over the years, he\u2019s had threats against him and has at times needed to take extra security precautions. He receives a host of antisemitic commentary, including a writeup years ago in a neo-Nazi publication. He\u2019s often listed as part of the \u201cdeep state\u201d despite never working in the government, and called a \u201cglobalist\u201d, a frequent antisemitic dog whistle, which he typically dismisses as trolling.</p> <p>He worries about his family. He worries about the people who work at his law firm every day, and about his clients, who have at times received blowback for their association with him.</p> <p>\u201cAnyone who tells you that Donald Trump targets them and they don\u2019t care, I think they\u2019re just lying to you,\u201d he said. \u201cI think anyone who says they\u2019re not afraid is either a psychopath or a liar. Of course you\u2019re afraid. Literally the president of the United States, who ran for election on a campaign of vengeance and revenge, is talking about you.

    "full_text": "Marc Elias, a prominent Democratic election attorney, has not shied away from standing up to the Trump administration, and has been targeted for retribution this year multiple times as a result.\n\nHe\u2019s one of scores of lawyers the Trump administration has named in executive actions, joining a list that includes big law firms and attorneys who worked for people Donald Trump considers his opponents.\n\nThere\u2019s no shortage of reasons why the president would hate Elias and want to shut him down: Elias has for decades represented high-profile Democrats, including the presidential campaigns of Hillary Clinton and Kamala Harris, and prominent liberal groups, including the Democratic national committee (DNC). He hired the research group that investigated Trump\u2019s ties to Russia in 2016, eventually becoming the Steele dossier. He specializes in election law and won 64 of the 65 cases he worked on in response to Trump\u2019s efforts to overturn the 2020 election results.\n\nIn one presidential memo, the Trump administration listed \u201cexamples of grossly unethical misconduct\u201d by lawyers, singling out Elias for his involvement in the Steele dossier. The law firm Elias used to work for, Perkins Coie, got its own presidential action that cited the dossier. Trump mentioned Elias by name in March at a Department of Justice press conference, calling him a \u201cradical\u201d who was trying to \u201cturn America into a corrupt, communist and third-world country\u201d.\n\nWhile a long list of big-name law firms have capitulated to Trump\u2019s demands, Elias says his firm was built to withstand the pressure and its important to him to use his platform to fight back, though his outspokenness often comes with pushback.\n\nThe presidential memo, which names Elias as an example of an attorney to target, directed the attorney general to \u201ctake all appropriate action to refer for disciplinary action\u201d any attorney that violated ethical guidelines and to \u201creview conduct by attorneys or their law firms in litigation against the Federal Government over the last 8 years\u201d.\n\nElias isn\u2019t aware he\u2019s under investigation, but said he thinks people not taking Trump literally is \u201cone of the great failings\u201d of his time in power.\n\n\u201cEvery day we wake up and we see another vindictive act by this administration against its political opponents, whether they be in elective office or be in the private sector,\u201d he said. \u201cI think anyone who uses their voice to speak up against Donald Trump needs to be realistic about the nature of this administration and the threats it poses.\u201d\n\nHe didn\u2019t escape scrutiny during Trump\u2019s first term. He first came up on Trump\u2019s radar, to his knowledge, when the president called him the Democrats\u2019 \u201cbest Election stealing lawyer\u201d after Elias went to work on a close Senate election in Florida in 2018.\n\nTrump\u2019s second term, though, is like \u201cday and night\u201d from his first, Elias said. The president is now \u201csingle-mindedly focused on going after his political opponents\u201d and any walls between Trump and the Department of Justice have crumbled.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very different thing when he is not just unleashing the hordes of hate on social media, not just activating the rightwing echo chamber, but is talking to people who are in positions of power to actually do something about his obsessions,\u201d Elias said.\n\nAnyone who tells you that Donald Trump targets them and they don\u2019t care, I think they\u2019re just lying to you Marc Elias\n\nDespite not posting on X anymore \u2013 his decision to stop using the platform prompted conspiracy theories from the right \u2013 he is far from quiet about his work and his opinions on the Trump administration. He posts often on other platforms, runs a democracy-focused outlet and files lawsuits against the Trump administration on the regular.\n\n\u201cEvery day we wake up and we see another vindictive act by this administration against its political opponents, whether they be in elective office or be in the private sector,\u201d he said. \u201cI think anyone who uses their voice to speak up against Donald Trump needs to be realistic about the nature of this administration and the threats it poses.\u201d\n\nIn response to questions about why the administration has targeted Elias, Davis Ingle, a spokesman for the White House, said Elias \u201cis a crooked hack who was deeply involved in creating a false \u2018dossier\u2019 against President Trump on behalf of his crooked client Hillary Clinton, in order to sway the 2016 election in her favor. Marc Elias is a disgraceful swamp creature and President Trump is draining that swamp.\u201d\n\nElias, Democratic superlawyer\n\nA lifelong Democrat, Elias helped build up election law to what it is today. When he was a young lawyer, it was a rare specialty \u2013 election disputes were typically seen as political issues, not legal ones. Now, post-election disputes are almost entirely legal issues.\n\nA 2008 Senate race in Minnesota in which Democrat Al Franken eventually won over Republican Norm Coleman turned the tide. Elias served as Franken\u2019s counsel in what became the longest recount in US history. At the time, some in his party said Franken should concede since Democrats had a strong majority in the Senate and Barack Obama had just won the White House. Elias is always on \u201cteam fight\u201d, he said, because \u201cas long as there is a legal fight to be had, we are going to have it\u201d.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to This Week in Trumpland Free newsletter A deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He has argued for increased coordination between outside political action committees and political parties, a move that Trump capitalized on for his ground game in 2024. In 2023, Joe Biden parted ways with Elias, with sources saying at the time that Biden\u2019s team had frustrations and discomfort with Elias\u2019s hard charging and big legal bills. That year, he also stopped representing the DNC.\n\n\u201cThere was a time where there were people who would say: \u2018Marc is too quick to litigate, and you can make bad law.\u2019 And I would say then, and I would certainly say now, what are you saving these laws for, if it is not for this moment? \u2026 We are in the break-glass moment of American history when it comes to free and fair elections and democracy and so, no, I don\u2019t have any hesitation about litigating everything that we possibly can to protect elections.\u201d\n\nHe worked at Perkins Coie until 2021, heading up its political law work and counting a host of big-name Democratic groups and elected officials as his clients. He started his own firm, Elias Law Group, after that, and Democracy Docket, which documents attacks on democracy.\n\nThe firm is built to \u201cwithstand the pressures of Donald Trump\u201d and only takes on clients from Democratic campaigns, the party itself, clients associated with Democratic politics or groups advancing voting rights on a nonpartisan basis. It does not take on corporate clients or clients with government contracts. That stance is part of why Elias thinks his firm itself hasn\u2019t been targeted in a Trump executive action. There are fewer ways to pressure him.\n\nElias was initially surprised at the executive orders targeting law firms because he thought the firms would fight back and win, and Trump would look foolish in the process. He didn\u2019t count on the \u201ccowardice\u201d of firms that instead struck up settlements with Trump, capitulating to the president\u2019s demands by dropping cases and giving massive amounts of pro bono work to conservative causes. The firms that did fight back, including Perkins Coie, have won, but it\u2019s hard to argue Trump didn\u2019t achieve his goals by going after lawyers, he said.\n\n\u201cI think he thought, if I can prevent big law from being that role, that\u2019ll make it easier for me to run roughshod over people\u2019s rights. And he\u2019s not wrong about that,\u201d Elias said. \u201cHe has actually intimidated a lot of law firms, I think, from taking on causes that they otherwise would have taken on.\u201d\n\nWhen CBS\u2019s 60 Minutes covered the crackdown on lawyers in May, host Scott Pelley noted that \u201cit was nearly impossible to get anyone on camera for this story because of the fear now running through our system of justice\u201d. Elias sat for an interview.\n\nElias has grappled with whether and how to speak up. Over the years, he\u2019s had threats against him and has at times needed to take extra security precautions. He receives a host of antisemitic commentary, including a writeup years ago in a neo-Nazi publication. He\u2019s often listed as part of the \u201cdeep state\u201d despite never working in the government, and called a \u201cglobalist\u201d, a frequent antisemitic dog whistle, which he typically dismisses as trolling.\n\nHe worries about his family. He worries about the people who work at his law firm every day, and about his clients, who have at times received blowback for their association with him.\n\n\u201cAnyone who tells you that Donald Trump targets them and they don\u2019t care, I think they\u2019re just lying to you,\u201d he said. \u201cI think anyone who says they\u2019re not afraid is either a psychopath or a liar. Of course you\u2019re afraid. Literally the president of the United States, who ran for election on a campaign of vengeance and revenge, is talking about you. Of course you\u2019re worried.\u201d",

We are waiting for them to begin negotiations,\u201d said a spokesperson for Nova Scotia\u2019s department of health and wellness.\n\nAdriana LaGrange, Alberta\u2019s minister of primary and preventative health services, said in a statement that the province has \u201cmade it clear\u201d it would like its share of federal funding to enhance coverage \u2013 but it has not received a response from Ottawa.\n\nShe also expressed sustainability concerns over the cost of the national pharmacare program, noting that Ottawa had already committed more than $900m of its original $1.5bn budget to just three provinces.\n\nOntario did not respond to questions, and its premier, the Conservative party\u2019s Doug Ford, has not been definitive on whether he supports pharmacare.\n\nJennifer Stevens, an NDP member of provincial parliament in Ontario who supports pharmacare, scoffed at those in her government who claim their current programs \u2013 covering contraception for people under 25 and over 65 \u2013 are adequate, given most women\u2019s reproductive years in Canada include their late 20s and 30s.\n\n\u201cThis is about logic, fairness and public good. So we need to get this Conservative government to the table,\u201d she said.\n\nOwusu-Akyeeah said urgent healthcare needs of the country cannot be put on hold while focusing on Trump or any other geopolitical issue.\n\n\u201cWe cannot lose sight of what continues to remain a core principle of Canadian identity, which is a universal healthcare system,\u201d she said.",
    "summary": "It was touted as a historic move that would change lives: in October 2024, Canada passed new legislation making all birth control free.\nBirth control is still not free across Canada.\nOnly three of the 10 provinces and one territory have deals in place \u2013 and the largest of them, British Columbia and Manitoba, already had free birth control.\n\u201cI\u2019m worried, because we know that Conservative premiers do not want to see access to free birth control,\u201d Singh said.\nManitoba is taking more than $226m over four years, while PEI signed up in March and began its free contraception program in May, taking $30m over four years.",

    "content": "<p>An unpublished short story from one of the 20th century\u2019s greatest authors is appearing for the first time in the <a href=\"https://strandmag.com/\">Strand</a> magazine this week, offering the suggestion that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/raymondchandler\">Raymond Chandler</a> suffered from previously unknown insecurities over his writing talents.</p> <p>Nightmare is an intriguing vignette that portrays Chandler, creator of the gritty fictional private detective Philip Marlowe, on the wrong side of the law, in a cell on death row awaiting execution for murder.</p> <p>The magazine\u2019s managing editor, Andrew Gulli, described the tale as a \u201csleep-induced sojourn\u201d that he discovered among a cache of papers belonging to Chandler\u2019s secretary and later-life companion Jean Vounder-Davis. A collection of her possessions, including <a href=\"https://ladailymirror.com/2024/12/06/raymond-chandler-auction-update/\">Chandler\u2019s typewriter</a> and a number of poems and private letters he had written, was <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/books/story/2024-12-10/raymond-chandler-auction-los-angeles-hollywood-science-fiction\">sold at auction</a> in New York in December.</p> <p>Gulli has previously uncovered lost, unknown or rarely seen creations from a range of prominent writers including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/may/14/graham-greene-short-ghost-story\">Graham Greene</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/sep/22/truman-capote-story-strand-magazine\">Truman Capote</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/nov/24/unseen-hg-wells-ghost-story-published-for-first-time\">HG Wells</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/nov/16/unseen-raymond-chandler-story-us-healthcare-it-s-all-right-he-only-died\">Chandler</a>, the Chicago-born, British-American author of classics such as The Big Sleep; Farewell, My Lovely; The Lady in the Lake; and The Long Goodbye. Chandler died in 1959 aged 70.</p> <p>The personal story also features Chandler\u2019s wife, Cissy, who, according to Gulli, said she thought Nightmare was \u201cvery funny\u201d. It means the story was written prior to her December 1954 death, but dating it precisely gets \u201ctricky\u201d beyond that, he said.</p> <p>More notable, he said, was that the content of the short story, which Chandler probably never intended to be published.

    "description": "The US president claims the painkiller also known as acetaminophen is linked to autism. Here\u2019s what the science says",
    "content": "<p>Donald Trump has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/22/trump-tylenol-experts-autism\">urged pregnant women not to take acetaminophen</a>, also known as Tylenol or paracetamol. He claimed it raises the chances of children being autistic.</p> \n<p>But the US president has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/sep/23/global-health-agencies-dismiss-false-trump-claim-everyday-painkillers\">condemned by experts from across the world</a>, who fear he is deliberately fostering a narrative of distrust that could be dangerous for women.</p> \n<p>So what does the science <em>actually</em> say?</p> \n<h2>Does paracetamol cause autism?</h2> \n<p>The short answer is: no. Genetics plays a major role in autism, but scientists are also investigating the potential role of environmental factors such as parental age, premature birth and prenatal exposure to drugs, environmental chemicals or infections.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe idea that something that occurs during pregnancy may influence neurodevelopment isn\u2019t a particularly new or crazy or outlandish idea,\u201d said Renee Gardner, an associate professor of epidemiology at Sweden\u2019s Karolinska Institute. \u201cWe know there\u2019s a large heritable or familial influence, but environment interacts with genetic tendencies.\u201d</p> \n<p>Paracetamol has been widely used for pain relief since the 1950s and is recommended by the NHS as the first choice of painkiller if you are pregnant. In recent years, <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40804730/\">a number of studies</a> have suggested that women who take paracetamol during pregnancy are very slightly more likely to have a child who is diagnosed with autism. But this does not prove that the link is causal and agencies such as the UK\u2019s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) have stated there is no evidence that taking paracetamol during pregnancy causes autism in children.</p> \n<h2>Why do some studies suggest a link between paracetamol and autism?</h2> \n<p>A big challenge in human studies is working out what genuinely contributes to autism and what is simply associated with the condition.</p> \n<p>\u201cLots of potential risk factors for autism have been investigated and when you are doing this kind of research, it can be very difficult to disentangle what is truly a cause,\u201d said Prof Laurie Tomlinson, professor of clinical epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. \u201cPeople taking paracetamol or not taking paracetamol in pregnancy may be different in many ways.\u201d</p> \n<p>For example, older women are more likely to have autistic children, but they are also more likely to have aches and pains and medical conditions that call for painkillers. For example, women with hypermobility have loose and stretchy ligaments that mean their joints have an unusually large range of motion. They are also more likely to have autistic children. Pregnancy can cause worse joint pain in women with hypermobility, making them more likely to take painkillers. If studies do not fully account for these factors, painkillers can wrongly appear to be a risk factor.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\"> <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><blockquote class=&quot;instagram-media&quot;

    "full_text": "Donald Trump has urged pregnant women not to take acetaminophen, also known as Tylenol or paracetamol. He claimed it raises the chances of children being autistic.\n\nBut the US president has been condemned by experts from across the world, who fear he is deliberately fostering a narrative of distrust that could be dangerous for women.\n\nSo what does the science actually say?\n\nDoes paracetamol cause autism? The short answer is: no. Genetics plays a major role in autism, but scientists are also investigating the potential role of environmental factors such as parental age, premature birth and prenatal exposure to drugs, environmental chemicals or infections. \u201cThe idea that something that occurs during pregnancy may influence neurodevelopment isn\u2019t a particularly new or crazy or outlandish idea,\u201d said Renee Gardner, an associate professor of epidemiology at Sweden\u2019s Karolinska Institute. \u201cWe know there\u2019s a large heritable or familial influence, but environment interacts with genetic tendencies.\u201d Paracetamol has been widely used for pain relief since the 1950s and is recommended by the NHS as the first choice of painkiller if you are pregnant. In recent years, a number of studies have suggested that women who take paracetamol during pregnancy are very slightly more likely to have a child who is diagnosed with autism. But this does not prove that the link is causal and agencies such as the UK\u2019s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) have stated there is no evidence that taking paracetamol during pregnancy causes autism in children.\n\nWhy do some studies suggest a link between paracetamol and autism? A big challenge in human studies is working out what genuinely contributes to autism and what is simply associated with the condition. \u201cLots of potential risk factors for autism have been investigated and when you are doing this kind of research, it can be very difficult to disentangle what is truly a cause,\u201d said Prof Laurie Tomlinson, professor of clinical epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. \u201cPeople taking paracetamol or not taking paracetamol in pregnancy may be different in many ways.\u201d For example, older women are more likely to have autistic children, but they are also more likely to have aches and pains and medical conditions that call for painkillers. For example, women with hypermobility have loose and stretchy ligaments that mean their joints have an unusually large range of motion. They are also more likely to have autistic children. Pregnancy can cause worse joint pain in women with hypermobility, making them more likely to take painkillers. If studies do not fully account for these factors, painkillers can wrongly appear to be a risk factor. Gardner and colleagues led the largest study to date on autism and paracetamol use during pregnancy, using health records of 2.4 million children born in Sweden between 1995 and 2019. They found that about 1.5% of children whose mothers were prescribed paracetamol during pregnancy were autistic, compared with 1.3% of children whose mothers were not prescribed the drug. However, when the researchers compared outcomes between siblings \u2013 removing genetics from the equation \u2013 the association between autism and paracetamol use disappeared completely. \u201cSome of the same genetic tendencies that increase people\u2019s risk of autism are overlapping with genes that influence immune response and pain perception, which are all things that might increase use of paracetamol,\u201d said Gardner. The researchers concluded there was no evidence to support a causal link and another Japanese study, published earlier this year, reached a similar verdict.\n\nWhy are autism rates rising? Forty years ago, about four to six people in every 10,000 had an autism diagnosis. Today, depending on the country, the rate is somewhere between 1% and 3%. Diagnosis has increased in adults as well as young children.
