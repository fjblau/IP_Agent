    "content": "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a>\u2019s budget would cut funding for the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) by 53%, eliminating 61 programs and laying off another 16% of health agency staff, according to a new report \u2013 moves that would drastically reduce disease prevention and fuel more chronic illness, public health leaders say.</p> <p>\u201cWe cannot lose this,\u201d said Joseph Kanter, CEO of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials (ASTHO). \u201cThis is crucial to the health of every person in every community across this country, whether they realize it or not.\u201d</p> <p>Federal cuts are already reverberating throughout the US. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration\">Trump administration</a> has clawed back more than $12bn from public health budgets.</p> <p>There have been delays in releasing funds already appropriated by Congress, which means local programs have had to shutter even when they were supposed to be funded. More than 20,000 employees have left health agencies in the past eight months because of layoffs, firings and resignations.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re facing really significant threats to our ability to invest in chronic disease prevention with what\u2019s been happening these last few months,\u201d said Lori Tremmel Freeman, CEO of the National Association of County and City Health Officials (Naccho).</p> <p>The public health system in the US is fragmented by state, but it is underpinned by funding and support from the CDC. Some 80% of the CDC\u2019s funding flows to state, local, territorial, and tribal health departments.</p> <p>\u201cCuts to federal funding are cuts to state and local public health budgets,\u201d said J Nadine Gracia, president and CEO of the Trust for America\u2019s Health (TFAH), a nonpartisan, non-profit public health policy research and advocacy organization.</p> <p>The organization has released reports on trends in state and federal funding for public health for more than two decades.</p> <p>But this year\u2019s TFAH <a href=\"https://www.tfah.org/report-details/funding-report-2025/\">report</a> is different as the US undergoes seismic shifts in health policy and priority, including funding cuts, staff layoffs, funding clawbacks and agency reorganizations, Gracia said in a media briefing with Kanter and Freeman.</p> <p>\u201cThe risks to our nation\u2019s health security are real and increasing,\u201d Gracia said.</p> <p>The new budget would end programs on cancer, diabetes, heart disease and stroke, obesity, global and domestic HIV/AIDS, global immunization, and substance use.</p> <p>The program on emergency preparedness for public health \u2013 the primary source of federal funding for state and local emergency preparedness \u2013 would be more than halved. Another 40 programs at the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) would also be cut.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s budget would move about 26% of the lost funding to two newly proposed divisions within the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS): the administration for a healthy America and the office of strategy.</p> <p>But it\u2019s not clear what those divisions would do, and the restructuring would reduce HHS staff by 16%.</p> <p>Entire divisions at the CDC have already been laid off, including those working on smoking cessation, drowning prevention, and tribal health.</p> <p>\u201c\u200bIn addition to the funding that CDC supports, CDC provides invaluable technical assistance and expert guidance,\u201d Kanter said.</p> <p>As the former local health director in New Orleans and former state health director in Louisiana, he said: \u201cI can name many, many outbreaks and other public health threats that I lacked the capacity to fully respond to, or the experts needed on my own within my agency, and relied on the CDC for expert opinions.\u201d</p> <p>Those still working in public health have found their resources and time stretched by new challenges under the Trump administration.</p> <p>Health departments across the country have spent the past few weeks scrambling to ensure Covid vaccines that were widely accessible only months ago are available again now.</p> <p>\u201cThis backtracking feels like the worst possible thing that can happen for public health,\u201d Freeman said.</p> <p>The US spends $4.9tn on healthcare each year, and <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/pcd/issues/2024/23_0267.htm\">90%</a> of that spending goes to chronic and mental health conditions. Public health works to prevent and manage these diseases \u201cfor a tiny fraction\u201d of those costs, in order to keep the spending from inflating even more, Freeman said.</p> <p>\u201cWe need prevention to work well, because the acute care system cannot withstand a large increase in sick patients across the country,\u201d Kanter said.</p> <p>Gracia noted that \u201cthe concern of reduced life expectancy [is] a sobering possibility, given that the US already has the lowest life expectancy among high-income nations.\u201d</p> <p>Rural areas are expected to be hit disproportionately hard by the shortages, as will communities that have been marginalized because of racism and poverty.</p> <p>Some programs, like substance use services, are funded largely through the CDC. Last year, overdose deaths dropped by nearly <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2835193\">27%</a> \u2013 encouraging but \u201cfragile\u201d progress that is now at risk, Gracia said.</p> <p>In 2026, the United States, as well as Mexico and Canada, will host the Fifa World Cup, the largest gathering in the world. Public health officials are preparing for potential outbreaks that could arrive with the international event.</p> <p>Yet the CDC\u2019s work tracking global health threats has also been slashed.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s much easier to stop an outbreak when it\u2019s small or limited to a particular region of one country than when it grows and crosses borders, and the CDC is so good at that. They\u2019re so good that very few people know about it,\u201d Kanter said \u2013 because many outbreaks are contained before they spread further.</p> <p>\u201cAs a health officer from a city that receives a lot of international travel, I\u2019ve been deeply, deeply thankful for that work. I think that work is in jeopardy.\u201d</p> <p>The US House of Representatives would cut $1.7bn from the CDC\u2019s budget, but the US Senate has <a href=\"https://www.naccho.org/blog/articles/senate-appropriations-committee-passes-fy26-labor-hhs-bill\">proposed</a> less steep cuts, potentially funding the agency close to previous levels.</p> <p>Public health \u201cis widely appreciated when people know about it\u201d, Kanter said.</p> <p>And \u201cthere remain thousands and thousands of deeply committed public health professionals who show up every day with one singular goal: to help make other people\u2019s lives better.\u201d</p>",

More than 20,000 employees have left health agencies in the past eight months because of layoffs, firings and resignations.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re facing really significant threats to our ability to invest in chronic disease prevention with what\u2019s been happening these last few months,\u201d said Lori Tremmel Freeman, CEO of the National Association of County and City Health Officials (Naccho).\n\nThe public health system in the US is fragmented by state, but it is underpinned by funding and support from the CDC. Some 80% of the CDC\u2019s funding flows to state, local, territorial, and tribal health departments.\n\n\u201cCuts to federal funding are cuts to state and local public health budgets,\u201d said J Nadine Gracia, president and CEO of the Trust for America\u2019s Health (TFAH), a nonpartisan, non-profit public health policy research and advocacy organization.\n\nThe organization has released reports on trends in state and federal funding for public health for more than two decades.\n\nBut this year\u2019s TFAH report is different as the US undergoes seismic shifts in health policy and priority, including funding cuts, staff layoffs, funding clawbacks and agency reorganizations, Gracia said in a media briefing with Kanter and Freeman.\n\n\u201cThe risks to our nation\u2019s health security are real and increasing,\u201d Gracia said.\n\nThe new budget would end programs on cancer, diabetes, heart disease and stroke, obesity, global and domestic HIV/AIDS, global immunization, and substance use.\n\nThe program on emergency preparedness for public health \u2013 the primary source of federal funding for state and local emergency preparedness \u2013 would be more than halved. Another 40 programs at the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) would also be cut.\n\nTrump\u2019s budget would move about 26% of the lost funding to two newly proposed divisions within the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS): the administration for a healthy America and the office of strategy.\n\nBut it\u2019s not clear what those divisions would do, and the restructuring would reduce HHS staff by 16%.\n\nEntire divisions at the CDC have already been laid off, including those working on smoking cessation, drowning prevention, and tribal health.\n\n\u201c\u200bIn addition to the funding that CDC supports, CDC provides invaluable technical assistance and expert guidance,\u201d Kanter said.\n\nAs the former local health director in New Orleans and former state health director in Louisiana, he said: \u201cI can name many, many outbreaks and other public health threats that I lacked the capacity to fully respond to, or the experts needed on my own within my agency, and relied on the CDC for expert opinions.\u201d\n\nThose still working in public health have found their resources and time stretched by new challenges under the Trump administration.\n\nHealth departments across the country have spent the past few weeks scrambling to ensure Covid vaccines that were widely accessible only months ago are available again now.\n\n\u201cThis backtracking feels like the worst possible thing that can happen for public health,\u201d Freeman said.\n\nThe US spends $4.9tn on healthcare each year, and 90% of that spending goes to chronic and mental health conditions. Public health works to prevent and manage these diseases \u201cfor a tiny fraction\u201d of those costs, in order to keep the spending from inflating even more, Freeman said.\n\n\u201cWe need prevention to work well, because the acute care system cannot withstand a large increase in sick patients across the country,\u201d Kanter said.\n\nGracia noted that \u201cthe concern of reduced life expectancy [is] a sobering possibility, given that the US already has the lowest life expectancy among high-income nations.\u201d\n\nRural areas are expected to be hit disproportionately hard by the shortages, as will communities that have been marginalized because of racism and poverty.\n\nSome programs, like substance use services, are funded largely through the CDC.

    "content": "<p>If Zohran Mamdani had not intended it as a campaigning opportunity, he probably wouldn\u2019t have worn a full suit \u2013 the universal candidate\u2019s uniform. But there he was, the 33-year-old Democratic nominee for November\u2019s New York City mayoral election; the upstart democratic socialist who has stormed on to the national stage with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/23/zohran-mamdani-new-york-city-mayor-race-viral\">a wildfire campaign</a> on an unabashedly progressive platform of affordability in one of the world\u2019s most expensive cities. Last Sunday, he <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/rmac.bsky.social/post/3lzecnxvwmc2j\">mingled in an Arsenal bar</a> in Brooklyn, <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/zohrankmamdani.bsky.social/post/3lzeoo5zx6k2y\">flanked by fellow Gooner Spike Lee</a>, peering at the big screen with a solemnity befitting the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/sep/21/arsenal-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report\">showdown with Manchester City</a>.</p> <p>Mamdani is the overwhelming favorite in the race to run the United States\u2019 largest city, sitting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/10/zohran-mamdani-new-york-mayor-poll\">15 points clear</a> of his nearest rival, Andrew Cuomo. Mamdani is potentially New York\u2019s first Muslim mayor. And also its first soccer mayor.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/sep/24/fifa-mens-world-cup-gianni-infantino-not-planning-64-team-expansion-trump-tower-summit\">Fifa not planning 64-team men\u2019s World Cup despite Infantino\u2019s Trump Tower summit</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He has waded into those waters repeatedly in the last few weeks. He launched a <a href=\"https://www.zohranfornyc.com/gameovergreed\">petition</a> pushing back against <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/sep/04/world-cups-dynamic-pricing-model-lays-bare-fifas-singular-motive-profit-at-all-costs\">Fifa\u2019s dynamic pricing model</a> for tickets at the 2026 World Cup, and demanding a price cap on resale tickets and an affordable allotment reserved for local residents. He <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxHZpvSiBIo\">announced the news through another of his instantly viral videos</a>, flashing the social media savvy and political acuity that excites his supporters so much, along with a surprisingly soft touch on the ball. Then he appeared on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/sep/10/zohran-mamdani-interview-fifa-petition-dynamic-pricing-football-weekly\">the Guardian\u2019s Football Weekly podcast</a>.</p> <p>There\u2019s some political theater to this, of course. Mamdani\u2019s petition is a very, very long shot to change Fifa\u2019s policy, even if he wins the election, as is expected. The petition\u2019s signup page on his website includes a handy box you can check to pledge to his campaign. But Mamdani was shrewd enough to understand that Fifa was there to be dunked on, and that the expected hyperinflation on World Cup tickets \u2013 America\u2019s disposable income <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/apr/08/fifa-infantino-us-soccer-cowherd-comments\">is why the sport has moved so many signature events stateside</a>, after all \u2013 dovetailed nicely with his affordability agenda.</p> <p>Besides, Mamdani made a good point by highlighting that tickets for the World Cup matches staged in Mexico <em>do </em>have a cap on resale pricing, thanks to exactly the type of government policy he espouses. It isn\u2019t such a long ideological leap for the candidate promising free bus fares and childcare, city-owned grocery stores, rent freezes, and a $30-per-hour minimum wage, to plead for New Yorkers to be able to attend World Cup games in their own backyard.</p> <p>Mamdani treading into a kind of soccer populism, however, is less interesting for the impact it may have on the sport than the distinct possibility that he\u2019s happened upon an untapped and useful force in American politics.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Zohran Mamdani on the Football Weekly podcast\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;instagram-media&quot;

    "full_text": "If Zohran Mamdani had not intended it as a campaigning opportunity, he probably wouldn\u2019t have worn a full suit \u2013 the universal candidate\u2019s uniform. But there he was, the 33-year-old Democratic nominee for November\u2019s New York City mayoral election; the upstart democratic socialist who has stormed on to the national stage with a wildfire campaign on an unabashedly progressive platform of affordability in one of the world\u2019s most expensive cities. Last Sunday, he mingled in an Arsenal bar in Brooklyn, flanked by fellow Gooner Spike Lee, peering at the big screen with a solemnity befitting the showdown with Manchester City.\n\nMamdani is the overwhelming favorite in the race to run the United States\u2019 largest city, sitting 15 points clear of his nearest rival, Andrew Cuomo. Mamdani is potentially New York\u2019s first Muslim mayor. And also its first soccer mayor.\n\nHe has waded into those waters repeatedly in the last few weeks. He launched a petition pushing back against Fifa\u2019s dynamic pricing model for tickets at the 2026 World Cup, and demanding a price cap on resale tickets and an affordable allotment reserved for local residents. He announced the news through another of his instantly viral videos, flashing the social media savvy and political acuity that excites his supporters so much, along with a surprisingly soft touch on the ball. Then he appeared on the Guardian\u2019s Football Weekly podcast.\n\nThere\u2019s some political theater to this, of course. Mamdani\u2019s petition is a very, very long shot to change Fifa\u2019s policy, even if he wins the election, as is expected. The petition\u2019s signup page on his website includes a handy box you can check to pledge to his campaign. But Mamdani was shrewd enough to understand that Fifa was there to be dunked on, and that the expected hyperinflation on World Cup tickets \u2013 America\u2019s disposable income is why the sport has moved so many signature events stateside, after all \u2013 dovetailed nicely with his affordability agenda.\n\nBesides, Mamdani made a good point by highlighting that tickets for the World Cup matches staged in Mexico do have a cap on resale pricing, thanks to exactly the type of government policy he espouses. It isn\u2019t such a long ideological leap for the candidate promising free bus fares and childcare, city-owned grocery stores, rent freezes, and a $30-per-hour minimum wage, to plead for New Yorkers to be able to attend World Cup games in their own backyard.\n\nMamdani treading into a kind of soccer populism, however, is less interesting for the impact it may have on the sport than the distinct possibility that he\u2019s happened upon an untapped and useful force in American politics.\n\nAllow Instagram content?

Her favourite player is John Yeates, captain in the 1960s. However, Cecil is reluctant to pick just one.

    "description": "Orb\u00e1nism offered Trump and the international populist right a blueprint, but its leader is under pressure at home from economic woes, falling support and P\u00e9ter Magyar\u2019s rise",
    "content": "<p>Bubble tea and all-day brunch, those reliable cultural signifiers for the social media age, seem as much in evidence in Budapest these days as old-school belle \u00e9poque coffee houses and tourists queueing for Danube cruises. There\u2019s something else new in the EU\u2019s only one-party state: politics has returned.</p> <p>For 15 years, Viktor Orb\u00e1n\u2019s electoral victories have been a foregone conclusion. But a credible political challenger to Orb\u00e1n has appeared. P\u00e9ter Magyar is no messiah: in fact, he is a defector from the ruling Fidesz party. But <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/europe-poll-of-polls/hungary/\">polls show Magyar</a> and his new-ish pro-western Tisza movement are on course to defeat Orb\u00e1n in April elections.</p> <p>Such an outcome would not just be a big deal for Hungarians. After years of Orb\u00e1n\u2019s obstructionism within the EU, its future, and that of European democracy more broadly, is also at stake.</p> <p>Hungary is what Hungarian political analysts such as P\u00e9ter Krek\u00f3 call an <a href=\"https://www.sciencespo.fr/department-economics/news/informational-autocrats/\">\u201cinformational\u201d autocracy</a>. This means Orb\u00e1nism deploys more artful ways to gag critics and maintain its grip than locking people up<strong>. </strong>Spinning populist narratives to turn public opinion against \u201cliberal elites\u201d is at the heart of how Orb\u00e1n has maintained far-right populist rule for 15 years \u2013 at the expense, many would say, of the rule of law and democracy, even beyond Europe.</p> <p>Orb\u00e1n\u2019s model \u2013 curtailing the independent media and fighting culture wars, while slicing away constitutional checks and balances \u2013 may have provided Donald Trump with a blueprint for the assault he is accused of launching on the democratic system in the US.</p> <p>\u201cI watched it happen in Hungary, now it\u2019s happening here,\u201d an ex-US ambassador to Hungary <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/23/opinion/hungary-viktor-orban.html\">warned in a New York Times column</a> recently. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/06/democracy-noir-viktor-orban-hungary-trump\">Democracy Noir</a>, a new Connie Field documentary about Orb\u00e1n, is being talked about as essential viewing for Americans because of the parallels it highlights between the Trump and Orb\u00e1n methods.</p> <p>Repackaged Maga ideology is now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/23/trump-culture-war-europe-promoting-rightwing-allies-report-finds\">boosting Europe\u2019s insurgent parties</a> on the populist right, in a remarkable feedback loop. Andrej Babi\u0161, an ally of both Orb\u00e1n and Marine Le Pen in France, is tipped for a return to power in the Czech Republic next month. Poland recently elected a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/06/nationalist-karol-nawrocki-sworn-in-as-polish-president\">nationalist president</a>. And in the UK all eyes are on Nigel Farage\u2019s Reform.</p> <p>Orb\u00e1nism is seen by many as the connecting thread.</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>Backlash in Europe\u2019s populism laboratory</strong></p>    <p>The Central European University could stand as a monument to Hungary\u2019s fate as a laboratory for reversing democracy. Once a symbol of academic freedom and liberal thought in post-communist eastern Europe, its Budapest campus has no students. In 2017, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-46427810\">Orb\u00e1n passed a law</a> forcing the George Soros-affiliated institution into exile.</p> <p>The former lecture halls were busy last week though, as the capital\u2019s progressive mayor Gergely Kar\u00e1csony \u2013 a thorn in Orb\u00e1n\u2019s side \u2013 hosted a \u201cdemocracy forum\u201d and warned politicians from elsewhere in Europe to start defeating \u201cthe narratives that make people support populists\u201d. Whether Hungarians themselves are ready for non-populist answers to their problems remains to be seen.</p> <p>\u201cOrb\u00e1n fatigue\u201d is prevalent, according to the academic Zsuzsanna Szel\u00e9nyi, a former politician, even in the PM\u2019s rural voter base. But the urgent issue for most people is the economy.

    "full_text": "Bubble tea and all-day brunch, those reliable cultural signifiers for the social media age, seem as much in evidence in Budapest these days as old-school belle \u00e9poque coffee houses and tourists queueing for Danube cruises. There\u2019s something else new in the EU\u2019s only one-party state: politics has returned.\n\nFor 15 years, Viktor Orb\u00e1n\u2019s electoral victories have been a foregone conclusion. But a credible political challenger to Orb\u00e1n has appeared. P\u00e9ter Magyar is no messiah: in fact, he is a defector from the ruling Fidesz party. But polls show Magyar and his new-ish pro-western Tisza movement are on course to defeat Orb\u00e1n in April elections.\n\nSuch an outcome would not just be a big deal for Hungarians. After years of Orb\u00e1n\u2019s obstructionism within the EU, its future, and that of European democracy more broadly, is also at stake.\n\nHungary is what Hungarian political analysts such as P\u00e9ter Krek\u00f3 call an \u201cinformational\u201d autocracy. This means Orb\u00e1nism deploys more artful ways to gag critics and maintain its grip than locking people up. Spinning populist narratives to turn public opinion against \u201cliberal elites\u201d is at the heart of how Orb\u00e1n has maintained far-right populist rule for 15 years \u2013 at the expense, many would say, of the rule of law and democracy, even beyond Europe.\n\nOrb\u00e1n\u2019s model \u2013 curtailing the independent media and fighting culture wars, while slicing away constitutional checks and balances \u2013 may have provided Donald Trump with a blueprint for the assault he is accused of launching on the democratic system in the US.\n\n\u201cI watched it happen in Hungary, now it\u2019s happening here,\u201d an ex-US ambassador to Hungary warned in a New York Times column recently. Democracy Noir, a new Connie Field documentary about Orb\u00e1n, is being talked about as essential viewing for Americans because of the parallels it highlights between the Trump and Orb\u00e1n methods.\n\nRepackaged Maga ideology is now boosting Europe\u2019s insurgent parties on the populist right, in a remarkable feedback loop. Andrej Babi\u0161, an ally of both Orb\u00e1n and Marine Le Pen in France, is tipped for a return to power in the Czech Republic next month. Poland recently elected a nationalist president. And in the UK all eyes are on Nigel Farage\u2019s Reform.\n\nOrb\u00e1nism is seen by many as the connecting thread.\n\nBacklash in Europe\u2019s populism laboratory\n\nView image in fullscreen P\u00e9ter Magyar, leader of the Tisza party, addresses supporters in K\u00f6tcse \u2013 emerging as the strongest rival to Viktor Orb\u00e1n in years. Photograph: Bernadett Szab\u00f3/Reuters\n\nThe Central European University could stand as a monument to Hungary\u2019s fate as a laboratory for reversing democracy. Once a symbol of academic freedom and liberal thought in post-communist eastern Europe, its Budapest campus has no students. In 2017, Orb\u00e1n passed a law forcing the George Soros-affiliated institution into exile.\n\nThe former lecture halls were busy last week though, as the capital\u2019s progressive mayor Gergely Kar\u00e1csony \u2013 a thorn in Orb\u00e1n\u2019s side \u2013 hosted a \u201cdemocracy forum\u201d and warned politicians from elsewhere in Europe to start defeating \u201cthe narratives that make people support populists\u201d. Whether Hungarians themselves are ready for non-populist answers to their problems remains to be seen.\n\n\u201cOrb\u00e1n fatigue\u201d is prevalent, according to the academic Zsuzsanna Szel\u00e9nyi, a former politician, even in the PM\u2019s rural voter base. But the urgent issue for most people is the economy.

Underestimating him would be foolhardy.\n\nNevertheless, Krek\u00f3, director of the independent Political Capital thinktank, detects a crack in the \u201ctotal confidence\u201d that has long typified the regime.\n\nOrb\u00e1n\u2019s attempt to ban Budapest Pride in June backfired. The march was the biggest ever, thanks in part to Kar\u00e1csony \u2013 a massive show of rainbow flags and anti-government defiance.\n\nKrek\u00f3 also cites a Fidesz wobble over a \u201cchilling, draconian\u201d bill that would have blacklisted organisations with any foreign connections. It has been put on hold, one theory suggests, because of internal Fidesz concerns that it could backfire on them.\n\n\u201cThis shows the government is weaker than before; the economic situation is dire; in opinion polls it is lagging behind Tisza; diplomatically within the EU its lack of allies has become quite desperate,\u201d Krek\u00f3 said.\n\nYet, Orb\u00e1n commands a formidable armoury. A suite of generous exchequer-funded enticements, such as top-ups for pensioners and tax cuts for mothers of two children or more, can be expected.\n\n\u201cIn 2022, Fidesz spent 6% of Hungary\u2019s GDP in transfers which people received before the elections. A lot of women and nobody under 25 pays income tax any longer. We can expect more of the same this time,\u201d Szel\u00e9nyi said.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to This is Europe Free weekly newsletter The most pressing stories and debates for Europeans \u2013 from identity to economics to the environment Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

    "description": "Bath, the defending champions, are favourites to retain their title but Saracens will be boosted by Owen Farrell\u2019s return",
    "content": "<h2>Bath</h2> <p>There have been six different title winners in as many seasons but the defending champions are favourites to buck that trend. In Johan van Graan Bath have a relentlessly process-driven coach, not someone who would allow an ounce of complacency to creep in, and they have Ollie Lawrence and Jaco Coetzee back for the start of the season after long-term injuries.</p> <p>With the blockbuster additions of Henry Arundell and Santiago Carreras, Bath have a backline to die for and this could be the season Max Ojomoh announces himself on the international stage.</p> <p>If we are looking for pitfalls, Lee Blackett\u2019s departure to England is undoubtedly a blow while Finn Russell played an awful lot of rugby last season and his minutes must be managed accordingly. Bath, however, begin the new campaign as the team to beat.</p> <p><strong>Last season</strong> 1st <strong>Predicted finish </strong>1st <strong>Key player</strong> Finn Russell</p> <h2>Bristol</h2> <p>The Bears have made the headline signing of the summer and Louis Rees-Zammit looks tailor-made for the most devastating attack in the league. The thought of Rees-Zammit and Gabriel Ibitoye on opposite wings will give opponents nightmares and in midfield, pairing Tom Jordan alongside Benhard Janse van Rensburg could be equally explosive.</p> <p>Ellis Genge may have lost his British &amp; Irish Lions Test place as the series wore on but he comes out of the tour in immense credit. George Kloska, James Dun and Joe Batley are three English forwards who cannot be too far away from Steve Borthwick\u2019s thinking and Pat Lam, the director of rugby, has high hopes for the arriving Georgian back-row Luka Ivanishvili.</p> <p>As ever, the key with Bristol is knitting together such attacking potency with effective game management. In other words, finding a template that might have enabled them to capitalise on first-half dominance in their semi-final defeat by Bath last season.</p> <p><strong>Last season</strong> 4th <strong>Predicted finish </strong>3rd <strong>Key player</strong> Benhard Janse van Rensburg</p>    <h2>Exeter</h2> <p>The suspicion is that things cannot go as badly as last season and the signings of the Wallabies Tom Hooper and Len Ikitau have looked better every match Australia have played of late. Manny Feyi-Waboso has had a minor setback in pre-season but is there or thereabouts and Rob Baxter, the director of rugby, has laid down the law after a dismal campaign in which the coaches Rob Hunter and Ali Hepher were suspended.</p> <p>Baxter took a more hands-on approach as a result \u2013 Hunter left the club while Hepher is back in an academy role \u2013 and this season is a true test of his coaching ability. Can the man behind the Chiefs\u2019 unprecedented rise to Premiership and Champions Cup winners breathe new life into the club or will another season of regression bring about an overhaul at Sandy Park? They could do with some leadership at half-back \u2013 where they still look light \u2013 if it is to be the former.</p> <p><strong>Last season</strong> 9th <strong>Predicted finish </strong>8th <strong>Key player</strong> Tom Hooper</p> <h2>Gloucester</h2> <p>Another side striving for balance this season after overhauling their gameplan last term, putting all their chips on attack and yielding some stunning performances along the way as a result. Tempering that all-out attack without blunting their ambition will be key for George Skivington, the head coach, who saw a promising campaign end in disappointment with a couple of powderpuff showings against Saracens and Harlequins.</p> <p>How Ross Byrne settles in at fly-half and whether Tomos Williams can put his Lions disappointment behind him and reproduce last season\u2019s form will go a long way to dictating Gloucester\u2019s fortunes this term. The progress of Afo Fasogbon and Seb Atkinson will be intriguing while Ben Loader and Will Joseph are two summer arrivals with buckets of talent and the potential to be stars at Kingsholm.</p> <p><strong>Last season</strong> 5th <strong>Predicted finish </strong>6th <strong>Key player</strong> Tomos Williams</p>    <h2>Harlequins</h2> <p>Troubled waters appear to be ahead for the 2021 champions, who have lost Danny Wilson, the head coach, to Wales on the eve of the season and promoted Jason Gilmore to senior coach while they seek a long-term replacement. Last season Quins were unable to cope with the void left by Andr\u00e9 Esterhuizen\u2019s departure, and they have undergone something of a rebuild over the summer.</p> <p>The front five in particular has a fresh look to it and Danny Care\u2019s retirement is significant because it is another experienced head they have lost, coming in the same season as Joe Marler\u2019s. It is a pivotal season ahead for Marcus Smith, who is on the fringes of the England side and will surely be tempted again by a lucrative move to France if Harlequins struggle and he cannot win back Steve Borthwick\u2019s favour. It should not be forgotten that their 2021 success was born amid turmoil but to suggest they will repeat the trick feels optimistic.</p> <p><strong>Last season</strong> 7th <strong>Predicted finish </strong>9th <strong>Key player</strong> Jack Kenningham</p> <h2>Leicester</h2> <p>Geoff Parling has a tough act to follow, arriving after Australia\u2019s series defeat by the Lions and seeking to pick up from where Michael Cheika left off after just one season in charge. Cheika\u2019s rebuild was impressive, making the Tigers so difficult to beat and the extent to which Parling wants to rip it up and start again or build on the foundations will be telling.</p> <p>James O\u2019Connor\u2019s ever-so-brief arrival \u2013 before jetting back to Australia \u2013 seemed a bit odd but clearly Parling wants him involved as soon as possible, while the fitness of George Martin could be key to how Leicester fare pre-Christmas. Any squad that loses Handr\u00e9 Pollard, Ben Youngs, Mike Brown, Juli\u00e1n Montoya and Dan Cole forfeits a huge amount of experience, even if not all have left the building entirely.</p> <p><strong>Last season</strong> 2nd <strong>Predicted finish </strong>7th <strong>Key player</strong> Joe Heyes</p>    <h2>Newcastle</h2> <p>Optimism abounds in the north-east after the takeover by Red Bull. Steve Diamond has been able to make a raft of canny signings \u2013 most on one-year deals \u2013 as a result and the longer-term future for Newcastle looks promising indeed. It is easy to forget the human element too \u2013 such investment allows the club to go shopping for world-class operators for next season but it allows the current squad the reassurance of knowing that they have a level of security that they would have questioned not so long ago.</p> <p>Liam Williams is perhaps the most eye-catching signing but Tom Christie, Fergus Lee-Warner, Christian Wade and Amanaki Mafi are all shrewd recruits. It may not be enough to keep them off the bottom of the table come June, particularly if injuries hit, but they will be far more competitive than recent seasons. Expect a fast start, too.</p> <p><strong>Last season</strong> 10th <strong>Predicted finish </strong>10th <strong>Key player</strong> Amanaki Mafi</p> <h2>Northampton</h2> <p>They could not really cope with England\u2019s reliance on the spine of their team, coupled with some high-profile departures including Courtney Lawes, last term. The Saints have sought to beef up their pack \u2013 Danilo Fischetti and Callum Chick can expect plenty of game-time \u2013 and Anthony Belleau is a fascinating signing at fly-half given how few French internationals tend to play in the Premiership these days.</p> <p>How Henry Pollock copes with second-season syndrome will be important, as will the management of his fellow England and Lions players Tommy Freeman, Fin Smith and Alex Mitchell. A fit-again George Furbank will feel like a new player and Saints, particularly at home, will always be worth a watch. Choosing Hull as the destination for their pre-season trip suggests a determination to add a bit of grit.</p> <p><strong>Last season</strong> 8th <strong>Predicted finish </strong>5th <strong>Key player</strong> Alex Mitchell</p> <h2>Sale</h2> <p>Under Alex Sanderson the Sharks have mastered the art of timing their run for the playoffs, finding their form after the Six Nations and demonstrating that their uber-physical, defensively robust style is best suited to the stage of the season when the stakes are that little bit higher. Sale have been the quietest in terms of comings and goings over the summer so expect more of the same.</p> <p>They look a little light at lock, with Jonny Hill and Le Roux Roets moving on, and as ever, much will depend on how they manage Tom Curry through the season.

    "full_text": "Bath\n\nThere have been six different title winners in as many seasons but the defending champions are favourites to buck that trend. In Johan van Graan Bath have a relentlessly process-driven coach, not someone who would allow an ounce of complacency to creep in, and they have Ollie Lawrence and Jaco Coetzee back for the start of the season after long-term injuries.\n\nWith the blockbuster additions of Henry Arundell and Santiago Carreras, Bath have a backline to die for and this could be the season Max Ojomoh announces himself on the international stage.\n\nIf we are looking for pitfalls, Lee Blackett\u2019s departure to England is undoubtedly a blow while Finn Russell played an awful lot of rugby last season and his minutes must be managed accordingly. Bath, however, begin the new campaign as the team to beat.\n\nLast season 1st Predicted finish 1st Key player Finn Russell\n\nBristol\n\nThe Bears have made the headline signing of the summer and Louis Rees-Zammit looks tailor-made for the most devastating attack in the league. The thought of Rees-Zammit and Gabriel Ibitoye on opposite wings will give opponents nightmares and in midfield, pairing Tom Jordan alongside Benhard Janse van Rensburg could be equally explosive.\n\nEllis Genge may have lost his British & Irish Lions Test place as the series wore on but he comes out of the tour in immense credit. George Kloska, James Dun and Joe Batley are three English forwards who cannot be too far away from Steve Borthwick\u2019s thinking and Pat Lam, the director of rugby, has high hopes for the arriving Georgian back-row Luka Ivanishvili.\n\nAs ever, the key with Bristol is knitting together such attacking potency with effective game management. In other words, finding a template that might have enabled them to capitalise on first-half dominance in their semi-final defeat by Bath last season.\n\nLast season 4th Predicted finish 3rd Key player Benhard Janse van Rensburg\n\nView image in fullscreen Bristol\u2019s Benhard Janse van Rensburg evades a tackle during the Premiership match against Leicester in April. Photograph: Steven Paston/PA\n\nExeter\n\nThe suspicion is that things cannot go as badly as last season and the signings of the Wallabies Tom Hooper and Len Ikitau have looked better every match Australia have played of late. Manny Feyi-Waboso has had a minor setback in pre-season but is there or thereabouts and Rob Baxter, the director of rugby, has laid down the law after a dismal campaign in which the coaches Rob Hunter and Ali Hepher were suspended.\n\nBaxter took a more hands-on approach as a result \u2013 Hunter left the club while Hepher is back in an academy role \u2013 and this season is a true test of his coaching ability. Can the man behind the Chiefs\u2019 unprecedented rise to Premiership and Champions Cup winners breathe new life into the club or will another season of regression bring about an overhaul at Sandy Park? They could do with some leadership at half-back \u2013 where they still look light \u2013 if it is to be the former.\n\nLast season 9th Predicted finish 8th Key player Tom Hooper\n\nGloucester\n\nAnother side striving for balance this season after overhauling their gameplan last term, putting all their chips on attack and yielding some stunning performances along the way as a result. Tempering that all-out attack without blunting their ambition will be key for George Skivington, the head coach, who saw a promising campaign end in disappointment with a couple of powderpuff showings against Saracens and Harlequins.\n\nHow Ross Byrne settles in at fly-half and whether Tomos Williams can put his Lions disappointment behind him and reproduce last season\u2019s form will go a long way to dictating Gloucester\u2019s fortunes this term. The progress of Afo Fasogbon and Seb Atkinson will be intriguing while Ben Loader and Will Joseph are two summer arrivals with buckets of talent and the potential to be stars at Kingsholm.\n\nLast season 5th Predicted finish 6th Key player Tomos Williams\n\nView image in fullscreen Gloucester\u2019s Tomos Williams in action against Exeter in April 2025. His Lions tour was ended by a hamstring injury in a warm-up match. Photograph: David Davies/PA\n\nHarlequins\n\nTroubled waters appear to be ahead for the 2021 champions, who have lost Danny Wilson, the head coach, to Wales on the eve of the season and promoted Jason Gilmore to senior coach while they seek a long-term replacement. Last season Quins were unable to cope with the void left by Andr\u00e9 Esterhuizen\u2019s departure, and they have undergone something of a rebuild over the summer.\n\nThe front five in particular has a fresh look to it and Danny Care\u2019s retirement is significant because it is another experienced head they have lost, coming in the same season as Joe Marler\u2019s. It is a pivotal season ahead for Marcus Smith, who is on the fringes of the England side and will surely be tempted again by a lucrative move to France if Harlequins struggle and he cannot win back Steve Borthwick\u2019s favour. It should not be forgotten that their 2021 success was born amid turmoil but to suggest they will repeat the trick feels optimistic.\n\nLast season 7th Predicted finish 9th Key player Jack Kenningham\n\nLeicester\n\nGeoff Parling has a tough act to follow, arriving after Australia\u2019s series defeat by the Lions and seeking to pick up from where Michael Cheika left off after just one season in charge. Cheika\u2019s rebuild was impressive, making the Tigers so difficult to beat and the extent to which Parling wants to rip it up and start again or build on the foundations will be telling.\n\nJames O\u2019Connor\u2019s ever-so-brief arrival \u2013 before jetting back to Australia \u2013 seemed a bit odd but clearly Parling wants him involved as soon as possible, while the fitness of George Martin could be key to how Leicester fare pre-Christmas. Any squad that loses Handr\u00e9 Pollard, Ben Youngs, Mike Brown, Juli\u00e1n Montoya and Dan Cole forfeits a huge amount of experience, even if not all have left the building entirely.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to The Breakdown Free weekly newsletter The latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewed Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Photograph: Gary Mitchell, GMP Media/Alamy\n\nNewcastle\n\nOptimism abounds in the north-east after the takeover by Red Bull. Steve Diamond has been able to make a raft of canny signings \u2013 most on one-year deals \u2013 as a result and the longer-term future for Newcastle looks promising indeed. It is easy to forget the human element too \u2013 such investment allows the club to go shopping for world-class operators for next season but it allows the current squad the reassurance of knowing that they have a level of security that they would have questioned not so long ago.\n\nLiam Williams is perhaps the most eye-catching signing but Tom Christie, Fergus Lee-Warner, Christian Wade and Amanaki Mafi are all shrewd recruits. It may not be enough to keep them off the bottom of the table come June, particularly if injuries hit, but they will be far more competitive than recent seasons. Expect a fast start, too.\n\nLast season 10th Predicted finish 10th Key player Amanaki Mafi\n\nNorthampton\n\nThey could not really cope with England\u2019s reliance on the spine of their team, coupled with some high-profile departures including Courtney Lawes, last term. The Saints have sought to beef up their pack \u2013 Danilo Fischetti and Callum Chick can expect plenty of game-time \u2013 and Anthony Belleau is a fascinating signing at fly-half given how few French internationals tend to play in the Premiership these days.\n\nHow Henry Pollock copes with second-season syndrome will be important, as will the management of his fellow England and Lions players Tommy Freeman, Fin Smith and Alex Mitchell. A fit-again George Furbank will feel like a new player and Saints, particularly at home, will always be worth a watch. Choosing Hull as the destination for their pre-season trip suggests a determination to add a bit of grit.\n\nLast season 8th Predicted finish 5th Key player Alex Mitchell\n\nSale\n\nUnder Alex Sanderson the Sharks have mastered the art of timing their run for the playoffs, finding their form after the Six Nations and demonstrating that their uber-physical, defensively robust style is best suited to the stage of the season when the stakes are that little bit higher. Sale have been the quietest in terms of comings and goings over the summer so expect more of the same.\n\nThey look a little light at lock, with Jonny Hill and Le Roux Roets moving on, and as ever, much will depend on how they manage Tom Curry through the season. Ben Curry has emerged as a key operator for Steve Borthwick too, which will affect Sale. Asher Opoku-Fordjour should go from strength to strength while Nathan Jibulu\u2019s presence at hooker promises to be eye-catching.

    "description": "One of the world\u2019s finest cricket umpires who became a popular celebrity known for his comic anecdotes and quirky ways",
    "content": "<p>Dickie Bird, who has died aged 92, was one of the most beloved, proficient and eccentric sporting figures of his generation. That an overwrought cricket umpire would become one of the most instantly identifiable figures in the country might seem unlikely, but his popularity extended far beyond the game to which he dedicated his life.</p> <p>Bird was part respected cricket umpire, part music-hall comedian. His life became a perpetual run of gently embellished anecdotes, all of which cast him as the unfortunate fall guy struggling to cope with the challenges of the world. He would tell them with relish, looking round with mock unease that somebody might be listening. The more people who heard him the better: he generally liked an audience. </p> <p>\u201cThe only time I ever feel in control is when I cross that white line,\u201d Bird said. For more than 20 years, he was regarded as the finest umpire in the world, an accolade that, as his career progressed, he earned as much from the pleasure he brought as from the accuracy of his decisions. </p> <p>He reached prominence at exactly the right time. Two years after he stood in his first Test in 1973 came the first World Cup final, and entertainers \u2013 even if they were just umpires with a stooping gait and an angsty disposition \u2013 were highly valued. By the time he stood in his farewell Test in 1996 it was a more serious age: technology had taken hold, television umpires had been installed and every decision came under the utmost scrutiny. There was less patience for a funny little man with a flat cap, a range of mannerisms and a sense of theatre. </p> <p>Players respected him because of his instinctive fairness, his unabashed pleasure in their performance and because he offered light relief during the cricket treadmill. It is hard to imagine an international fast bowler today handing over a sweater to an umpire with a rubber snake hidden inside it, as the Australian Dennis Lillee once did; or a modern-day version of the time Alan Lamb \u201caccidentally\u201d brought his mobile phone out to the middle while playing for England and gave it to Bird for safe keeping, leaving Ian Botham to complete the gag by ringing it from the dressing room. </p> <p>In his native Yorkshire, cricket followers protected him fiercely, as they might protect a vulnerable child, even if they would curse him when he turned down yet another lbw decision or barrack him when he fussed over a lengthy stoppage for the weather. The public valued the quirky ways that brought colour to the dullest day. What they sensed was an essential humanity.</p>    <p>There was no side to him, no hidden agenda. His umpiring was scrupulously fair, even if he needed the help of his colleagues to get him through the most agitated days. Rain and bad light seemed to haunt him, never more so than in the 1980 Centenary Test between England and Australia at Lord\u2019s, when 10 hours were lost to rain in the first three days and he was moved to tears by the abuse he received. </p> <p>The establishment was grateful for his loyalty \u2013 he was no rebel, cried tears of joy when appointed MBE in 1986 and was a frequent visitor to Buckingham Palace \u2013 although <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/england/content/player/8515.html\">Sir Gubby Allen</a>, a massively influential figure at Lord\u2019s, spoke for many of a conservative mindset when he remarked: \u201cHe\u2019s a damn fine umpire but I must have a word with him about all this fussing around.\u201d</p> <p>That fussing around was the source of a fund of stories that grew longer by the year. He was so worried about being late, for example, that he would invariably arrive hours ahead of time \u2013 he once had to scale a wall at Lord\u2019s after arriving so early that the ground was still locked. In 1984, confused about the regulations during an early-season Benson and Hedges Cup tie between Scotland and Yorkshire at Perth, he called two tea intervals. Whether it was bomb scares or pitch invasions, reflecting greenhouses or errant pigeons, they all conspired to trouble him.</p> <p> During Michael Atherton\u2019s England captaincy, having fumbled his pocket-full of marbles that he used to count the deliveries, his cry that he had \u201clost his marbles\u201d brought general merriment.</p> <p>Born in Barnsley, South Yorkshire, he grew up in a two-up, two-down terrace house, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2003/nov/21/smalltalk.sportinterviews\">where he was known as Dennis</a>, and was educated at Raley secondary modern in the town.

    "content": "<p>Marie Antoinette: the Fragonard cupcake who bankrupted France with her lust for fashion and diamonds, who bottle-fed pet lambs while her people starved. No matter that, in truth, her frocks and jewels were small fry in her country\u2019s financial ruin; the optics, as we would say now, were terrible. So what if she never actually said \u201clet them eat cake\u201d \u2013 history is no match for a great soundbite.

Born Maria Antonia Josepha Johanna von \u00d6sterreich-Lothringen in Vienna, Austria, in 1755, she was sent to Paris by her mother, the empress of Austria, to be married to the French dauphin when she was 14. Her fiance, the grandson of the reigning king, was just a year older. She was a pawn in complex European diplomacy \u2013 it was said that her mother would have preferred to send an older daughter, but her sisters were married, dead or too pockmarked to please the image-conscious French court \u2013 and her pale-skinned, blue-eyed beauty sealed the deal. She married Louis-Auguste two days after meeting him.</p>    <p>The dauphine was an outsider at Versailles. The French, who had only just finished fighting Austria on the battlefields, were suspicious of the young foreigner. Her teenage husband was a weak, colourless character, while Marie Antoinette \u2013 who loved fashion, and launched a trend for hair worn 3ft high and decorated with feathers \u2013 had main-character energy in spades.</p>    <p>She was a spectacular dresser, no doubt about that \u2013 for her husband\u2019s coronation, she wore an embroidered gown swagged with sapphires \u2013 but there was more creativity, and more strategy, to her look than her cartoonish historical image as a Versailles Barbie suggests. Before her reign, fashion in the French court had been the domain of the kings\u2019 mistresses. Queens were conventional, domestic figures. Marie Antoinette, childless for the first eight years of her marriage, found her status as a royal wife \u2013 and a foreign one, at that \u2013 increasingly precarious as a result.</p> <p>So she leaned into fashion not merely as entertainment, but as a way to boost her profile, as mistresses before her had done. She appeared at one masked ball dressed as Gabrielle d\u2019Estr\u00e9es, the Renaissance mistress of Henri IV, in a confection of silver and white gauze girdled with diamonds and edged with gold silk fringing. Her chief collaborator in image-making was her dressmaker, Rose Bertin, dubbed the \u201cminister of fashion\u201d by the press. Together they set a trend for Rococo pastels, and for wedding-cake gowns iced with a fever dream of embroidery, ribbons and ruffles. Her wardrobe was her own splendid livery, a defiant statement of feminine power.</p>    <p>In 1781, she was said to have spent 750,000 livres \u2013 the currency of the day \u2013 on diamonds, and almost a million on porcelain. For context, the daily wage for most of her subjects was three livres. The French public, angered by the huge debts being incurred by the elites, were quite understandably furious, and found a lightning rod for their discontent. As the financial crisis deepened in the 1780s, with the price of a loaf of bread rising to almost a full day\u2019s pay, she earned the nickname Madame Deficit.

Born Maria Antonia Josepha Johanna von \u00d6sterreich-Lothringen in Vienna, Austria, in 1755, she was sent to Paris by her mother, the empress of Austria, to be married to the French dauphin when she was 14. Her fiance, the grandson of the reigning king, was just a year older.

She married Louis-Auguste two days after meeting him.</p>    <p>The dauphine was an outsider at Versailles. The French, who had only just finished fighting Austria on the battlefields, were suspicious of the young foreigner.

Before her reign, fashion in the French court had been the domain of the kings\u2019 mistresses. Queens were conventional, domestic figures. Marie Antoinette, childless for the first eight years of her marriage, found her status as a royal wife \u2013 and a foreign one, at that \u2013 increasingly precarious as a result.</p> <p>So she leaned into fashion not merely as entertainment, but as a way to boost her profile, as mistresses before her had done.

Her chief collaborator in image-making was her dressmaker, Rose Bertin, dubbed the \u201cminister of fashion\u201d by the press.

The French public, angered by the huge debts being incurred by the elites, were quite understandably furious, and found a lightning rod for their discontent.

    "full_text": "Welcome to the resistance, Tucker Carlson?\n\nForgive me; I\u2019m sorry; mea culpa! Having spent considerable time analyzing the events of the past week, I\u2019ve realized I should probably issue a public apology for some of my statements over the years. Here we go: I\u2019m sorry for expressing radical and dangerous opinions such as \u201cwomen deserve equal rights and shouldn\u2019t be treated like walking wombs\u201d. I\u2019m sorry for suggesting Palestinians shouldn\u2019t be systematically exterminated while Donald Trump posts about building a resort in Gaza. Going forward I will do better and ensure that I double-check all my opinions with the government. There isn\u2019t an official Department of Thought Control yet, but no doubt we\u2019ll get there soon.\n\nI wish I was joking about all this but, as you will have noticed, we are in a critical moment for free speech in the US. The killing of Charlie Kirk was a tragedy for his family, but the Trump administration has been ruthlessly using Kirk\u2019s death to further a crackdown on dissent and erode first amendment protections.\n\nThe day after Kirk was fatally shot, for example, the deputy secretary of state, Christopher Landau, urged people to report any \u201cforeigners\u201d to the state department who post on social media \u201cpraising, rationalizing, or making light of the event\u201d. The US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, later said that the state department has \u201cmost certainly been denying visas\u201d to people celebrating Kirk\u2019s death. It\u2019s obviously not in good taste to celebrate anyone\u2019s murder, but the fact that calling out Kirk\u2019s divisive and bigoted views could possibly be considered \u201crationalizing\u201d his death and get you deported is chilling.\n\nIt\u2019s not just foreigners who are being told they should be wary about what they say. On Monday Vice-President JD Vance, who was guest-hosting an episode of the Charlie Kirk Show, encouraged people to report anyone celebrating the influencer\u2019s death to that person\u2019s employer. Presumably so said employer can fire them.\n\nThere have, of course, already been numerous Kirk-related firings and suspensions. An employee at the Federal Emergency Management Agency was reportedly placed on administrative leave over an Instagram post describing Kirk as \u201cthe literal racist homophobe misogynist.\u201d MSNBC fired political analyst Matthew Dowd after he suggested Kirk\u2019s \u201cawful words\u201d fueled \u201cawful actions\u201d. Jimmy Kimmel\u2019s late-night show was suspended \u201cindefinitely\u201d after he noted \u201cmany in Maga Land are working very hard to capitalize on the murder of Charlie Kirk\u201d. Washington Post columnist Karen Attiah has also said she was fired over social media posts after Kirk\u2019s killing.\n\nThe weaponization of Kirk\u2019s death is so alarming that even one of Trump\u2019s former allies is rattled. Tucker Carlson, the former Fox News host who was once one of the loudest voices in the Magasphere, recently issued a stark warning about the way that the Trump administration appears to be leveraging Kirk\u2019s murder to trample civil liberties.\n\n\u201cYou hope that a year from now, the turmoil we\u2019re seeing in the aftermath of [Kirk\u2019s] murder won\u2019t be leveraged to bring hate speech laws to this country,\u201d Carlson said on Wednesday during an episode of his podcast. This was in reference to attorney general Pam Bondi\u2019s comments (which she has now walked back) that the Trump Department of Justice would \u201ctarget\u201d people disseminating \u201chate speech\u201d following Kirk\u2019s killing.\n\n\u201cAnd trust me, if it is, if that does happen, there is never a more justified moment for civil disobedience than that, ever,\u201d Carlson added. \u201cBecause if they can tell you what to say, they\u2019re telling you what to think \u2026 There is nothing they can\u2019t do to you because they don\u2019t consider you human.\u201d\n\nLike Marjorie Taylor Greene, the far-right congresswoman who has recently started speaking a limited amount of sense on certain topics, Carlson is no ally to progressives. Indeed Carlson\u2019s hate-mongering, and his former public cheerleading for Trump, are a large part of why we are in such a mess. But the fact that even a far-right voice like Carlson is worried about the authoritarian direction in which the US is heading should chill you to the bones. Carlson appears to have realized that no one is safe in the dictatorship that Trump appears intent on building. Not even him.\n\nNuns on the run in Austria\n\nSister Regina, 86, Sister Rita, 81, and Sister Bernadette, 88, are doing it for themselves. And by \u201cit\u201d I mean defying their diocese by running away from their nursing home and returning to their former convent. The convent has no electricity or running water so the nuns have started an Instagram account and are crowdfunding for supplies.\n\nFrench first lady will present court with \u2018evidence\u2019 she is a woman\n\nRightwing influencer, crackpot and conspiracy theorist Candace Owens has repeatedly insisted that Brigitte Macron is actually a man. Owens even said she would \u201cstake [her] entire professional reputation\u201d on it. Now the Macrons, who are suing Owens for defamation, are submitting \u201cscientific evidence\u201d to a US court to prove Brigitte was not born male. RIP Owens\u2019s \u201cprofessional reputation\u201d.\n\nGirls and women in Colombia are being held as sex slaves\n\nThe country\u2019s Catatumbo region, near the border with Venezuela, has seen increased violence in recent years. The Guardian reports on more than 150 girls and women aged from 11 to 50 who have escaped what they describe as \u201csexual slavery\u201d by armed groups in the region.

Photograph: Elisabeth Mandl/Reuters\n\nThe games involved each team completing eight challenges twice over, with the drivers alternating roles each time, and points awarded for precision and timing. Along with tram bowling, the challenges included tram curling (using the tram to push a trolley along the track to a target point), speed and target braking (accelerating to 25km/h without the use of a speedometer, then stopping at a specific point) and reversing with the aid of a whistle.\n\nIn the stop-and-go challenge, a container of water was balanced on a platform at the front of the tram, and points were awarded according to how little water was spilt after three designated stops.

Those taking the highest dose, 36mg, lost an average of 11.2% of their body weight.\n\nAmong patients taking the highest doses, 54.6% had a reduction of 10% or more of body weight, 36% had a reduction of 15% or more, and 18.4% had a reduction of 20% or more.\n\nResearchers said other health metrics also improved among people taking the drug, including better blood pressure, a smaller waist circumference and a reduction in bad cholesterol levels.\n\nThe most common side-effects were gastrointestinal, which were said to be mild to moderate.\n\n\u201cIn adults with obesity, 72-week treatment with orforglipron led to significantly greater reductions in body weight than placebo,\u201d the authors wrote. \u201cThe adverse-event profile was consistent with that of other GLP-1 receptor agonists.\u201d\n\nWharton said: \u201cThis could mean an expansion of obesity interventions to groups who are currently excluded due to the cost of and lack of access to injectable medications.\u201d\n\nHealth leaders have hailed weight loss drugs as transformative. But injections come with additional work for health services, so tablet forms could help millions more people trying to lose weight.\n\nSeparate research published in JAMA Pediatrics on Monday shows weight loss jabs could be effective on children as young as six who are obese or have type 2 diabetes. However, stomach problems were \u201csignificantly more common\u201d among children taking the drugs, the researchers said.\n\nThey said longer follow-up periods in future trials and more real-world studies were \u201cessential to establish the long-term effects of GLP-1 RAs in children and adolescents\u201d.",
    "summary": "A daily pill for weight loss can help people reduce their body weight by as much as a fifth, according to a trial that could pave the way for millions more people to shed pounds.\nIn a trial of 3,127 adults, one in five people who took the once-a-day tablet for 72 weeks lost 20% or more of their body weight.\nThose taking the highest dose, 36mg, lost an average of 11.2% of their body weight.\n\u201cIn adults with obesity, 72-week treatment with orforglipron led to significantly greater reductions in body weight than placebo,\u201d the authors wrote.\nSeparate research published in JAMA Pediatrics on Monday shows weight loss jabs could be effective on children as young as six who are obese or have type 2 diabetes.",

    "description": "It is more than a century since Joyce crossed Europe by rail but there is still inspiration to be found on the overland journey to Trieste",
    "content": "<p>When James Joyce first travelled from Dublin to Trieste in 1904, he went via Paris, Zurich and Ljubljana. Zurich, because he mistakenly believed a job to be awaiting him there, and Ljubljana because \u2013 groggy after the night train \u2013 he thought they\u2019d pulled into Trieste. By the time he twigged, the train had departed and, without ready cash, Joyce and his partner Nora Barnacle had to spend a night on the tiles.</p> <p>Preferring to travel by train, when I received the invite to be writer-in-residence at the <a href=\"https://sites.units.it/triestejoyce/prevy/00.html\">James Joyce summer school</a> in Trieste, I wondered if I might follow Joyce\u2019s route. But repair work on Austria\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2025/jul/10/classic-rail-routes-through-alps-reopen-austria-switzerland-italy\">Tauern Tunnel</a> prevented me from taking the exact route. Besides, today\u2019s TGV tears through France at nearly 200mph, in comparison to the 25-60mph speeds at which Joyce would have navigated Switzerland and Austria. A night on the town in Milan is just as good for the muse.</p> <p>Along the route from London to Trieste (and then by bus to Ljubljana), I considered the lineage of writers who traversed Europe in this way 100 years ago and how different their aesthetic, physical and emotional experiences must have been. And, importantly, what they would have seen. What we see from trains \u2013 and how we see it \u2013 reflects a century of profound social, economic and environmental transformation. Trains represent progress as much as they ever have, but \u2013 today \u2013 a different sort of progress.</p>    <p>My journey got off to an eventful start when the Eurostar announced delays due to cable theft near Lille. Around 600 metres of copper cable were stolen overnight from the high-speed line. A testament to the proficiency of France\u2019s railway workers, we arrived roughly on time in Gare du Nord, Paris. A station where Joyce penned a letter to his brother, observing: \u201cI hate the bustle but the station has its own strange poetry, the sound of footsteps, the distant whistle of the steam engines, and the sudden clanging of the signal bell.\u201d For those sounds of steam whistling, coal shovelling, bells clanging, currencies exchanging and porters calling, today we have digital chimes, polylingual announcements, and beeping ticket barriers. Across the city, fake bird sounds chirp throughout Gare de Lyon, intending to induce calm, but instead making people search overhead for the poor trapped birds.</p> <p>Instead of the illustrated posters of the belle epoque, emblazoning the walls of the metro from Gare du Nord today are climate change equations from Liam Gillick\u2019s artwork <a href=\"https://www.estherschipper.com/exhibitions/264-the-logical-basis-liam-gillick/\">The Logical Basis</a>, commissioned for the COP21 climate conference held in Paris in 2015. Honouring the climate models of Nobel prize-winning physicist Syukuro Manabe, Gillick\u2019s work has been criticised for not explaining the equations, and so keeping the simple, crucial facts of climate change at a remove from the general public.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>When Italian police demanded the reason for my travel, I nodded at Ulysses on my tray table, which surely cast me as a bad spy</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It still seems to be the case that we don\u2019t understand our own impact on the climate crisis. Electrified trains allow us to travel with a fraction of the carbon footprint of air travel. I still fly but try to find alternatives when I can. Less mental and moral gymnastics are required when travelling by land or sea \u2013 especially while temperatures break all records. So trains are simply more relaxing \u2026 except financially. </p> <p>Virginia Woolf, who travelled solo from London to Turkey by train when she was 24, wrote that \u201ca traveller, even though he is half asleep, knows, looking out of the train window, that he must look now, for he will never see that town, or that mule-cart, or that woman at work in the fields, again\u201d. Never mind <em>that</em> woman, to see <em>any</em> person working in the fields from a train window these days is unlikely. Instead of vibrant country villages (and the explosion of cities taking place in the early 20th century), we have urban sprawl and suburbanisation that would have been unimaginable in Woolf\u2019s time. Instead of the diverse cereal and crop production of a century ago, today\u2019s fertilised pastures of animal agriculture and vast tracts of land used to grow animal feed dominate European landscapes. The consequences of that are everywhere, from the overall temperature (France is 1.9C warmer than it was in 1900) and weather pattern changes, to soil degradation, polluted air and waterways, and biodiversity loss. But to know how radically the landscape has changed in just a few decades is to know to what degree it can change again.</p>    <p>In the early 20th century, rail passengers would have witnessed the hydroelectric revolution, as water power in the Alps was being developed extensively. The construction of dams and reservoirs fundamentally altered alpine hydrology, creating the artificial lakes, dams, power lines and industrial infrastructure we\u2019re used to today. One undoubtedly positive change in the past 100 years has been a significant effort towards reforestation. And while those forests are generally commercial \u2013 with about 80% classified as \u201cforest available for wood supply\u201d \u2013 natural forests and meadows are almost instantly possible with a shift towards a plant-rich diet, as just one example. And pastures might be replaced with solar or wind farms. Perhaps there\u2019s something helpful in <em>seeing </em>where our energy comes from, so that we understand its impact. Writers took great courage in the hydroelectric revolution: it allowed them to reach the Alps by train. It represented progress, modernity and independence, as did the electric trains themselves.</p> <p>For a period, rail became militarised, and trains were rerouted for troop movements and deportations, with civilians facing extreme delays, rationing and danger. Joyce fled his home in Trieste (then part of the Austro-Hungarian empire) during the first world war, as he was considered an enemy alien. At Feldkirch station in Austria, he narrowly escaped arrest. (His brother had already been separately arrested, in Trieste, and was detained until the end of the war.) He later told his biographer that \u201cat Feldkirch station,\u201d he \u201cfelt the fate of Ulysses was decided\u201d. During the second world war, many writers and artists were among those who used Europe\u2019s rail network to flee the Nazis.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Post-Covid, there is something consoling in the quiet companionship of trains</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>When sniffer dogs boarded the TGV on the French-Italian border, and police demanded to see my passport and to know which bags were mine and the reason for my travel, I replied: \u201cThe James Joyce Summer School,\u201d propping up my <a href=\"https://booksupstairs.ie/\">Books Upstairs</a> tote bag and nodding at Ulysses on my tray table, which surely cast me as a bad spy. Before the first world war, passports and visas were rarely required within western Europe. After the war, this changed, and border stops were far longer and more frequent, to allow for paper checks.</p> <p>But if Joyce carried a passport in 1904, it would have been a British one, with him being classified as a British subject. I was surprised to discover that Joyce repeatedly rejected the opportunity to obtain an Irish passport, post-independence. I knew from reading his work that he spurned narrow nationalism, embracing a cosmopolitan and diverse European modernism. But to reject an Irish passport was to limit his practical freedoms.

    "author": "Caoilinn Hughes",
    "full_text": "When James Joyce first travelled from Dublin to Trieste in 1904, he went via Paris, Zurich and Ljubljana. Zurich, because he mistakenly believed a job to be awaiting him there, and Ljubljana because \u2013 groggy after the night train \u2013 he thought they\u2019d pulled into Trieste. By the time he twigged, the train had departed and, without ready cash, Joyce and his partner Nora Barnacle had to spend a night on the tiles.\n\nPreferring to travel by train, when I received the invite to be writer-in-residence at the James Joyce summer school in Trieste, I wondered if I might follow Joyce\u2019s route. But repair work on Austria\u2019s Tauern Tunnel prevented me from taking the exact route. Besides, today\u2019s TGV tears through France at nearly 200mph, in comparison to the 25-60mph speeds at which Joyce would have navigated Switzerland and Austria. A night on the town in Milan is just as good for the muse.\n\nAlong the route from London to Trieste (and then by bus to Ljubljana), I considered the lineage of writers who traversed Europe in this way 100 years ago and how different their aesthetic, physical and emotional experiences must have been. And, importantly, what they would have seen. What we see from trains \u2013 and how we see it \u2013 reflects a century of profound social, economic and environmental transformation. Trains represent progress as much as they ever have, but \u2013 today \u2013 a different sort of progress.\n\nView image in fullscreen Trieste, James Joyce\u2019s home until 1915. Photograph: Dreamer4787/Getty Images\n\nMy journey got off to an eventful start when the Eurostar announced delays due to cable theft near Lille. Around 600 metres of copper cable were stolen overnight from the high-speed line. A testament to the proficiency of France\u2019s railway workers, we arrived roughly on time in Gare du Nord, Paris. A station where Joyce penned a letter to his brother, observing: \u201cI hate the bustle but the station has its own strange poetry, the sound of footsteps, the distant whistle of the steam engines, and the sudden clanging of the signal bell.\u201d For those sounds of steam whistling, coal shovelling, bells clanging, currencies exchanging and porters calling, today we have digital chimes, polylingual announcements, and beeping ticket barriers. Across the city, fake bird sounds chirp throughout Gare de Lyon, intending to induce calm, but instead making people search overhead for the poor trapped birds.\n\nInstead of the illustrated posters of the belle epoque, emblazoning the walls of the metro from Gare du Nord today are climate change equations from Liam Gillick\u2019s artwork The Logical Basis, commissioned for the COP21 climate conference held in Paris in 2015. Honouring the climate models of Nobel prize-winning physicist Syukuro Manabe, Gillick\u2019s work has been criticised for not explaining the equations, and so keeping the simple, crucial facts of climate change at a remove from the general public.\n\nWhen Italian police demanded the reason for my travel, I nodded at Ulysses on my tray table, which surely cast me as a bad spy\n\nIt still seems to be the case that we don\u2019t understand our own impact on the climate crisis. Electrified trains allow us to travel with a fraction of the carbon footprint of air travel. I still fly but try to find alternatives when I can. Less mental and moral gymnastics are required when travelling by land or sea \u2013 especially while temperatures break all records. So trains are simply more relaxing \u2026 except financially.\n\nVirginia Woolf, who travelled solo from London to Turkey by train when she was 24, wrote that \u201ca traveller, even though he is half asleep, knows, looking out of the train window, that he must look now, for he will never see that town, or that mule-cart, or that woman at work in the fields, again\u201d. Never mind that woman, to see any person working in the fields from a train window these days is unlikely. Instead of vibrant country villages (and the explosion of cities taking place in the early 20th century), we have urban sprawl and suburbanisation that would have been unimaginable in Woolf\u2019s time. Instead of the diverse cereal and crop production of a century ago, today\u2019s fertilised pastures of animal agriculture and vast tracts of land used to grow animal feed dominate European landscapes. The consequences of that are everywhere, from the overall temperature (France is 1.9C warmer than it was in 1900) and weather pattern changes, to soil degradation, polluted air and waterways, and biodiversity loss. But to know how radically the landscape has changed in just a few decades is to know to what degree it can change again.\n\nView image in fullscreen James Joyce and his publisher, Sylvia Beach, in Paris in 1920. Photograph: Bettmann Archive\n\nIn the early 20th century, rail passengers would have witnessed the hydroelectric revolution, as water power in the Alps was being developed extensively. The construction of dams and reservoirs fundamentally altered alpine hydrology, creating the artificial lakes, dams, power lines and industrial infrastructure we\u2019re used to today. One undoubtedly positive change in the past 100 years has been a significant effort towards reforestation. And while those forests are generally commercial \u2013 with about 80% classified as \u201cforest available for wood supply\u201d \u2013 natural forests and meadows are almost instantly possible with a shift towards a plant-rich diet, as just one example. And pastures might be replaced with solar or wind farms. Perhaps there\u2019s something helpful in seeing where our energy comes from, so that we understand its impact. Writers took great courage in the hydroelectric revolution: it allowed them to reach the Alps by train. It represented progress, modernity and independence, as did the electric trains themselves.\n\nFor a period, rail became militarised, and trains were rerouted for troop movements and deportations, with civilians facing extreme delays, rationing and danger. Joyce fled his home in Trieste (then part of the Austro-Hungarian empire) during the first world war, as he was considered an enemy alien. At Feldkirch station in Austria, he narrowly escaped arrest. (His brother had already been separately arrested, in Trieste, and was detained until the end of the war.) He later told his biographer that \u201cat Feldkirch station,\u201d he \u201cfelt the fate of Ulysses was decided\u201d. During the second world war, many writers and artists were among those who used Europe\u2019s rail network to flee the Nazis.\n\nPost-Covid, there is something consoling in the quiet companionship of trains\n\nWhen sniffer dogs boarded the TGV on the French-Italian border, and police demanded to see my passport and to know which bags were mine and the reason for my travel, I replied: \u201cThe James Joyce Summer School,\u201d propping up my Books Upstairs tote bag and nodding at Ulysses on my tray table, which surely cast me as a bad spy. Before the first world war, passports and visas were rarely required within western Europe. After the war, this changed, and border stops were far longer and more frequent, to allow for paper checks.\n\nBut if Joyce carried a passport in 1904, it would have been a British one, with him being classified as a British subject. I was surprised to discover that Joyce repeatedly rejected the opportunity to obtain an Irish passport, post-independence. I knew from reading his work that he spurned narrow nationalism, embracing a cosmopolitan and diverse European modernism. But to reject an Irish passport was to limit his practical freedoms. Samuel Beckett\u2019s Irish passport allowed him to stay in France and take part in resistance activities. Spending the vast majority of their lives on the continent, they both strongly identified as European. Europeanness is surely defined \u2013 even today \u2013 more by train travel than by anything else.\n\nView image in fullscreen Caoilinn Hughes\u2019s journey to Trieste.\n\nDespite Frantz Fanon brilliantly immortalising a racist incident on a train in France in his book Black Skin, White Masks, rail travel in Europe has been a sanctuary from racial prejudice for many, like Jamaican-American writer Claude McKay and poet Langston Hughes.

Photograph: Viennaslide/Alamy\n\nFor \u00d6BB Nightjets to Amsterdam, Berlin, Bregenz, Brussels, Cologne, Dresden, Hamburg, Hanover, Milan, Paris, Venice and Zurich (also until late September, additionally with \u00d6BB Nightjets to Florence, Rome and Verona); for Euronight to Krak\u00f3w, Stuttgart and Warsaw; and other operators to Bucharest, Bra\u015fov, Kyiv and Lviv, plus summer-season overnight trains to Rijeka and Split\n\nFully opened 10 years ago, Vienna\u2019s Hauptbahnhof rates as one of Europe\u2019s most efficient transport hubs and boasts a greater range of destinations than any other station in Europe.\n\nFor a relaxed breakfast, skip the fast-food options in the station and head for Caf\u00e9 Goldegg, with its elegant wood panelling and art nouveau style (on corner of Goldeggasse and Argentinierstrasse). Ask nicely and they\u2019ll even knock you up a full English.\n\nFor evening eats, I recently followed the advice of Mark Smith, the legendary Man in Seat 61, and tried the excellent Ringsmuth at Johannitergasse 1 (closed Sun and Mon), a traditional Viennese restaurant with schnitzel galore as well as fish and veggie options.\n\nVienna Hauptbahnhof is south of the city centre. Three stops north on the U1 metro is Stephansplatz, where you can cleanse your soul at the lovely St Stephens Cathedral. Or go two stops south on the U1 to Reumannplatz to cleanse the body in art deco elegance at the wonderful Amelienbad indoor pool \u2013 a triumph of progressive socialist design. A visit will help make up for the lack of showers at the railway station for those arriving on night trains (but there are luggage lockers aplenty, from \u20ac2).\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Inside Saturday Free weekly newsletter The only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Then freshen up with a shower (mezzanine level, \u20ac12). And now it\u2019s time for breakfast \u2026\n\nMy go-to spot is Roots on Lintheschergasse, just two minutes from the platforms. Power porridge and avocado toast go down a treat after a night on the rails, as do all sorts of shakes and juices. For pre-departure supper, try Maru, a little oasis of Japan on level 2 of the shopping complex under the station serving matcha and \u201cJapanese comfort food\u201d.\n\nI love Zurich for its small-town feel. Having arrived on a night train and lingered over breakfast, I usually wander down pedestrianised Bahnhofstrasse and make for St Peterhofstatt, a haven of calm in the historic heart of the city.\n\nLondon\n\nView image in fullscreen The Caledonian Sleeper chugging through the Highlands\n\nPaddington station for the GWR Night Riviera for 11 destinations in Cornwall; Euston station for Caledonian Sleeper trains to 40-plus stations in Scotland\n\nLet\u2019s not forget London. The last direct night sleeper service to the continent stopped 45 years ago (that was the Night Ferry to Brussels and Paris, which for a spell even conveyed a through sleeping car to Switzerland) but you can slip between crisp, clean sheets in sleepers departing the UK capital for the Cornish coast or Scottish Highlands.\n\nArriving passengers can benefit from posh arrival lounges with free showers at both Paddington and Euston, although the facilities at the latter are only for those who booked en suite accommodation on the train.\n\nPassengers departing Euston should board early and head straight to the Club Car (seats are limited) for dinner for a taste of Scotland and a wee dram as they head north. Those departing from Paddington to Cornwall should take a chilled bottle of champagne to enjoy in the GWR lounge (the former royal waiting room) on Platform 1.\n\nNicky Gardner is co-author of Europe by Rail: The Definitive Guide.

Tuscany gets a lot of love, but travel one region over to Umbria and <a href=\"https://www.italia.it/en/italy/things-to-do/monti-sibillini-national-park\">Monti Sibillini national park</a> bewitches with views of the Apennines and eyrie-like, honey-coloured hill towns such as Castelluccio, soaring above a plateau of brightly coloured poppies, cornflowers and daisies. It\u2019s a gorgeous spot for hiking, biking and tracking down a trattoria to dig into specialities such as wild boar with locally grown lentils. You\u2019ll find some of Italy\u2019s finest salami in butcher shops in Norcia, as well as black truffles on the menus of restaurants such as the Michelin-starred <a href=\"https://www.vespasianorcia.com/en/index\">Vespasia</a>, which is in a 16th-century palazzo. Alternatively, you could join a <em>tartufaio</em> and their dog to head into the woods on a <a href=\"https://trufflehunting.tours/tour/norcia-truffle-hunting/\">truffle-hunting tour</a>.<br><strong>How to do it </strong>Organic farm <a href=\"https://www.casalenelparco.com/azienda-agricola/\">Agriturismo Casale nel Parco dei Monti Sibillini</a> (doubles from \u00a384 B&amp;B) has truffles and wild herbs in its grounds, and a terrific restaurant serving up local and homegrown produce.</p> <h2><strong>Mountain bik</strong><strong>ing and Munros in </strong><strong>Scotland</strong></h2>    <p>If you take rugged Highland scenery and turn the volume up, you get the <a href=\"https://www.visitcairngorms.com/\">Cairngorms national park</a>, a 1,748 square mile expanse of lochs, glens, forests and Munros. Providing the weather behaves, you\u2019ll be itching to get outdoors, whether climbing 1,245-metre (4,085ft) Cairn Gorm or 1,309-metre Ben Macdui, spotting capercaillie, red squirrels and ospreys in the Caledonian pine forest of <a href=\"https://www.lonelyplanet.com/scotland/aviemore/attractions/rothiemurchus-estate/a/poi-sig/1187213/1004645\">Rothiemurchus Estate</a>, or meeting the region\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.cairngormreindeer.co.uk/\">free-roaming reindeer</a> on a hill trip. There are wild swimming spots such as remote Loch Coire an Lochain, and visitors can go biking on <a href=\"https://www.cairngormmountain.co.uk/\">Cairngorm Mountain</a>\u2019s slopes. By night, there\u2019s fantastic stargazing in the <a href=\"https://www.cairngormsdarkskypark.org/\">Cairngorms Dark Sky Park</a> around Tomintoul and Glenlivet.<br><strong>How to do it</strong> A train from London to Aviemore takes 7-8 hours. It\u2019s free to wild camp in the park. Or stay at a self-catering forest cabin at <a href=\"https://www.cairngormlodges.co.uk/\">Cairngorm Lodges</a> (two-nights from \u00a3264) on the park\u2019s eastern fringes.</p> <h2><strong>Alpine lake swimming and high-level hiking</strong><strong> in Austria</strong></h2>    <p>Between the Brandenberg Alps and the limestone turrets of the Wilder Kaiser massif, Kufstein is a full-on Alpine fantasy, capped with a medieval <a href=\"https://www.festung.kufstein.at/\">fortress</a>. The fact that it\u2019s a living town, rather than a resort, means there\u2019s a great buzz here in summer. And Kufstein\u2019s backyard is beautiful. Within minutes, you can reach Wilder Kaiser\u2019s hiking trails on a <a href=\"https://www.naturerlebnis-kaisergebirge.at/en/summer-cable-cars/kaiserlift-kufstein.html\">single-seat chairlift</a> floating above treetops and meadows to the 1,256-metre peak of Brentenjoch. The landscape is dotted with lakes such as forest\u2011rimmed Hechtsee, mountain\u2011flanked Stimmersee and glass-green Thiersee, where you can dive into some of Austria\u2019s cleanest waters or rent a paddleboard.<br><strong>How to do it</strong> Kufstein is half an hour from Innsbruck or an hour from Munich by train. Camp by the lakes or stay in town at historic <a href=\"https://auracher-loechl.at/\">Auracher L\u00f6chl</a> (doubles from \u00a3175 B&amp;B). The local guest pass gives you free use of public transport.</p> <h2><strong>Switzerland\u2019s only </strong><strong>national </strong><strong>park is hiking heaven</strong></h2>    <p>With the Alps running across 60% of Switzerland, it\u2019s incredible that this green and lovely land has just one national park. But it\u2019s a good one. Slamming into Italy, the <a href=\"https://nationalpark.ch/\">Swiss national park</a> in Graub\u00fcnden\u2019s Engadin valley is an utterly wild Unesco biosphere reserve. Nature has been in charge here since the park\u2019s formation in 1914, and as a result, it\u2019s hiking heaven. The full-day, 13-mile trek from Zernez to <a href=\"https://www.engadin.com/en/hike-macun-lakes\">Lais da Macun</a> (the Macun lakes) takes in a plateau beaded with 23 Alpine lakes. If you prefer company, sign up for guided <a href=\"https://nationalpark.ch/\">ranger walks</a>, including a wildlife-focused one in the <a href=\"https://www.maps.engadin.ch/en/tour/mountain-hike/val-trupchun-in-the-swiss-national-park/1508614/\">Val Trupchun</a> where, with luck and binoculars, you might spot marmots, ibex, chamois, deer and bearded vultures.<br><strong>How to do it</strong> With good rail connections, Zernez is the gateway to the park and home to the visitor centre. <a href=\"https://nationalpark.ch/en/visit/guided-walks/\">Guided ranger hikes cost about \u00a336</a>. For an off-grid sleep, book <a href=\"https://nationalpark.ch/en/visit/accommodation/chamanna-cluozza/\">Chamanna Cluozza</a> (dorm beds \u00a364). Deep in a forest, the hut is a 3\u00bd-hour hike from Zernez. Bring your sleeping bag.</p> <h2><strong>Cycling around Lake Constance</strong><strong> \u2013 and through three countries</strong></h2>    <p>For uplifting views of the Alps by bike without the uphill slog, Lake Constance is unbeatable. Central Europe\u2019s third largest lake, it delivers a massive shot of everything that makes Europe great \u2013 Roman ruins, medieval castles, gardens, gorges, wetlands, vineyards, orchards, thermal baths and beaches where you can strip off sweaty Lycra for a quick swim or a night spent camping under the stars. Looping around the lake and taking about a week to complete, the 170-mile (273km) <a href=\"https://www.bodensee-radweg.com/\">Lake Constance Cycle Path</a>, or Bodensee-Radweg as it\u2019s known locally, is the biggie, rolling through three countries: Germany, Austria and Switzerland.<br><strong>How to do it</strong> Avoid the midsummer madness of July and August for fewer crowds. Bikes and ebikes can be rented in towns fringing the lake. Konstanz in Germany is a great springboard, with good rail connections.</p> <h2><strong>Turquoise lakes and</strong><strong> Europe\u2019s biggest ice cap in Norway</strong></h2>    <p>Mother nature had a wild time in <a href=\"https://www.visitnorway.com/listings/jostedalsbreen-national-park/5160/\">Jostedalsbreen national park</a> in western Norway, delivering a visual feast of mountain-flanked fjords, ice-blue glacial lakes and \u2013 the clincher \u2013 the 37-mile-long Jostedalsbreen, mainland Europe\u2019s biggest ice cap. Ways to explore are many and varied \u2013 there\u2019s an easy four-mile round trek past waterfall-wisped peaks to Briksdalsbreen, an offshoot of the mighty glacier, or an opportunity to kayak, canoe and paddleboard across the turquoise waters of Lovatnet Lake, with rock walls punching above. For a close encounter with the ice, slip on a helmet and crampons to trek across the Haugabreen arm of the glacier.<br><strong>How to do it</strong> On the dreamy shores of Lovatnet Lake, <a href=\"https://sande-camping.no/en/campingplassen/\">Sande Camping</a> (pitches from \u00a318) is a crazily pretty spot to pitch a tent. Breogfjell Mountain Guides run <a href=\"https://breogfjell.no/en/tur/glaciertour/\">six-hour guided glacier walks</a> (\u00a384) from mid-June to August.</p> <h2><strong>Swimming and kayaking in the </strong><strong>Julian Alps in Slovenia</strong></h2>    <p>If you think Lake Bled is ridiculously lovely, wait until you clap eyes on Lake Bohinj, tucked away in the Julian Alps that tear across <a href=\"https://www.slovenia.info/en/stories/visit-triglav-national-park-with-respect\">Triglav national park</a> in Slovenia\u2019s north-west. Here, limestone turrets and pinnacles rise like natural fortifications above forests and glacial lakes that chart the spectrum of blues and greens. Loveliest of the lot is mirror-like Lake Bohinj, where you can dive into jewel-coloured waters that reach 22C in summer. The pebble beach in Ukanc, on the lake\u2019s western shore, is as lovely a spot as any. Arrive early in the morning and you\u2019ll have it all to yourself as you swim, canoe, kayak or paddleboard in glassy waters.<br><strong>How to do it</strong> Pitch a tent on the shore at eco-friendly <a href=\"https://www.camp-bohinj.si/\">Camp Bohinj</a> (pitches from \u00a325). At the boathouse, <a href=\"https://en.pac.si/\">Pac Sport</a> rents out paddleboards, canoes, kayaks and wooden rowboats.</p> <h2><strong>A long-distance trek</strong><strong> </strong><strong>in the Dolomites</strong><strong> in Italy</strong></h2>    <p>In the fiery blush of a summer sunset, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/dolomites\">Dolomites</a> are at their most entrancing, as the gold-pink light burnishes their buttresses, pinnacles and great fangs of rock. You can admire them from below, but you\u2019ll get much closer on the 75-mile Alta Via 1, one of Italy\u2019s most memorable hikes, reaching from Dobbiaco in the north to Belluno in the south. Negotiating steep, rocky inclines is rewarded with sublime views and stays at rustic huts like <a href=\"https://rifugiolagazuoi.com/index_en.php\">Rifugio Lagazuoi</a> and <a href=\"https://cortinadelicious.it/EN/s4-tipo-3-Cinque-Torri-Refuge\">Rifugio Cinque Torri</a>, where you can dig into local specialities like polenta, venison and <em>canederli</em> (bread dumplings with speck and cheese), peer up at star-blanketed night skies and get a crack\u2011of-dawn start on the trail.<br><strong>How to do it</strong> While the walk is certainly doable alone (book huts ahead for summer and get hold of <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/alta-via-1-trekking-in-the-dolomites-9781786310811/\">Cicerone\u2019s Alta Via 1 guide</a>), logistically it\u2019s easier to join a tour, such as the 10-night trip offered by <a href=\"https://www.alpineexploratory.com/holidays/dolomites-alta-via-1.html\">Alpine Exploratory</a> (from \u00a32,880 <a href=\"https://www.alpineexploratory.com/holidays/dolomites-alta-via-1-guided.html\">guided</a>, \u00a31,790 <a href=\"https://www.alpineexploratory.com/holidays/dolomites-alta-via-1.html#tabs\">self-guided</a>).</p> <h2><strong>Castle-hopping in Germany\u2019s Bavarian Alps</strong><strong> </strong></h2>    <p>Where the Bavarian Alps muscle their way into Austria, F\u00fcssen looks like something out of a children\u2019s story. The old town\u2019s alleys are stacked with gabled, frescoed houses and cafe-lined squares, and lofty castles bear the fantastical imprint of \u201cMad\u201d King Ludwig II (1845-1886). Mad or not, he had an eye for a winning location, which you\u2019ll appreciate when you visit the riotously turreted and recently revamped <a href=\"https://www.neuschwanstein.de/englisch/tourist/index.htm\">Schloss Neuschwanstein</a>, which was the blueprint for Disney\u2019s Sleeping Beauty castle, and <a href=\"https://www.hohenschwangau.de/en\">medieval Hohenschwangau</a>, where little Ludwig grew up. There\u2019s hiking, cycling and swimming at the lakes around F\u00fcssen, such as Forggensee, Hopfensee and Alpsee. All can be reached by bus for free with the local F\u00fcssen Card.<br><strong>How to do it</strong> F\u00fcssen is two hours from Munich by bus and train (<a href=\"https://bahn.de/\">bahn.de</a>). Take your pick of hotels and B&amp;Bs in the town, such as <a href=\"https://www.hotel-fuessen.de/en/\">Hotel Sonne </a>(doubles from \u00a3130 B&amp;B) in the historic centre, or camp by one of the lakes.</p> <h2><strong>The ultimate m</strong><strong>ountain bike park in the French Alps </strong></h2>    <p>The French Alps punch high above Morzine in <a href=\"https://www.portesdusoleil.com/les-portes-du-soleil/les-stations/morzine/\">Portes du Soleil</a>, 12 resorts strung between Lake Geneva and mighty Mont Blanc. Everyone raves about winter skiing in this chalet-lined village, but there\u2019s lots happening in summer, when the steep slopes are given over to one of the world\u2019s biggest <a href=\"https://www.bikemorzine.com/morzine/information/morzine-bike-park\">bike parks</a> \u2013 400 miles (650km) of single tracks and heart-racing downhill trails. An extensive network of bike-friendly lifts links them up nicely. If you\u2019re up for a bone-rattling challenge, tackle the Noire de Morzine from the <a href=\"https://en.portesdusoleil.com/offers/pleney-gondola-morzine-en-3831663/\">Le Pl\u00e9ney</a> cable car station. After you\u2019ve stripped off sweaty Lycra and body armour, cool off with a swim in one of the crystal-clear lakes on Morzine\u2019s doorstep, such as mountain\u2011clasped Lac de Montriond or forest-rimmed Mines d\u2019Or. You can reach both within minutes on the free village buses.<br><strong>How to do it</strong> <a href=\"https://www.alpytransfers.com/\">Alpy Transfers</a> runs regular coaches between Geneva airport and Morzine (2 hours, one-way \u00a317), prebooking is essential. <a href=\"https://en.morzine-avoriaz.com/discover-morzine/summer/multi-pass/\">Morzine\u2019s Multi Pass</a> gets you access to lifts, lakes and lidos for \u00a32.50 a day. For a rustic-chic place to sleep, check into <a href=\"https://montamour.fr/chalet/13/jardin-secret#googtrans(fr)\">Jardin Secret</a> (doubles from \u00a3115) in Montriond, a self-catering micro-lodge with a sun terrace, hot tub and easy access to both slopes and lakes.</p> <h2><strong>Walking in Spain\u2019s wild Picos de Europa</strong></h2>    <p>Spain is at its most ravishing in the 250-square-mile <a href=\"https://parquenacionalpicoseuropa.es/english/plan-your-visit/\">Picos de Europa national park</a> in the Cantabrian mountains of the north. Here you can hike among jagged, lake-splashed peaks, ancient oak and beech forests, and deep, wildflower-flecked valleys where it\u2019s silent enough to hear your own heartbeat \u2013 or perhaps the cry of a golden eagle. The untamed terrain here is best explored with a guide. For a deep dive, <a href=\"https://www.muchbetteradventures.com/products/10318-adventures-hut-to-hut-trekking-picos-de-europa-spain/\">Much Better Adventures</a> arranges a challenging hut-to-hut trek, ticking off highs such as the glacial Lakes of Covadonga, the 2,319-metre summit of La Padiorna and the sheer-walled Cares Gorge.<br><strong>How to do it</strong> Much Better Adventures\u2019 six-night, small-group trek costs from \u00a3875 per person, including local guides, breakfast, dinner and stays in mountain huts and rural guesthouses.</p> <h2><strong>Waterfalls, springs and caves at Plitvice Lakes</strong><strong> in</strong><strong> Croatia</strong></h2>    <p>Most people who head to Croatia dash straight to the coast, but a step back from the Adriatic is the Unesco World Heritage site <a href=\"https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/98/\">Plitvice Lakes national park</a>. Against the backdrop of the karstic Dinaric Alps, the park has mineral-rich springs, cascading falls, caves and lakes that glitter jade, aquamarine, ink-blue and turquoise. Brown bears, wild boar, lynx and wolves prowl the old-growth beech and fir forests, and clouds of blue-winged butterflies bring a fairytale touch in summer. For a true flavour of the park, bring binoculars and follow the 11-mile Route K, a full-day hike that knits together all 16 of the lakes.<br><strong>How to do it</strong> From Zagreb, buses and <a href=\"https://www.flixbus.co.uk/\">FlixBus</a> coaches run frequently to Plitvi\u010dka Jezera in just over two hours. There are lots of traditional stone-and-wood villas where you can spend the night, including <a href=\"https://plitvicevillaverde.com/\">Villa Verde</a> (doubles from \u00a393 B&amp;B).</p> <h2><strong>A front-row view of the Eiger</strong><strong> in</strong><strong> Switzerland</strong></h2>    <p>Switzerland\u2019s outrageously beautiful Jungfrau region is the Alps on steroids, with its crashing waterfalls, gemstone lakes, cliff-hugging villages and the glacier-capped big three of the Eiger, M\u00f6nch and Jungfrau looming above it all. You could base yourself anywhere in these heights and reach the summits within minutes on vintage railways and state-of-the-art cable cars \u2013 but Grindelwald has the edge for outdoor adventure. As lively in summer as winter, the village has front-row views of the Eiger\u2019s mile-high north face. The <a href=\"https://www.jungfrau.ch/en-gb/eiger-express/\">Eiger Express</a> cable car links up to Eigergletscher, the trailhead for the astoundingly scenic, two-hour <a href=\"https://www.jungfrau.ch/en-gb/kleine-scheidegg/eiger-trail/\">Eiger Trail</a>. Or you can thunder towards the Eiger on ziplines, mountain carts and chunky scooters called <a href=\"https://www.jungfrau.ch/en-gb/grindelwaldfirst/trottibike-scooter/\">Trottibikes</a> from the <a href=\"https://www.jungfrau.ch/en-gb/grindelwaldfirst/\">First</a> cable car station above Grindelwald.<br><strong>How to do it</strong> Grindelwald is well connected by rail and can be reached in around nine hours from London via Paris, Strasbourg, Basel and Interlaken. Hotels are pricey, but you can save by camping at riverside <a href=\"https://gletscherdorf.ch/\">Gletscherdorf</a> (pitches from \u00a336).</p> <h2><strong>Practise yoga among</strong><strong> Austria\u2019s </strong><strong>Alpine peaks</strong></h2>    <p>Sky-scraping peaks, scary slopes and apr\u00e8s-ski parties draw folk to St Anton am Arlberg in Tyrol in winter. But when the snow melts, the village reveals its mellower side, with trails skipping through flower-freckled pastures to Alpine dairy huts like <a href=\"https://www.stantonamarlberg.com/en/summer/mountain-region/mountain-huts/-addresses/putzen-alpe\">Putzen Alpe</a>, where you can sample a <em>brettljause</em> (sharing board) of local ham and cheese, and watch the bell-swinging cows come home in the honeyed light of late afternoon. If you want to zone out even more from the rush of daily life, St Anton is right up there with the best places in the Alps for a spot of peak-gazing while doing yoga. Pick a meadow to practise your positions or sign up for classes and retreats at <a href=\"https://www.arlflow.at/\">Arlflow</a>.<br><strong>How to do it</strong> St Anton is an hour from Innsbruck by train. In early September, the four-day <a href=\"https://www.mountainyogafestivalstanton.at/en/\">Mountain Yoga Festival</a>, celebrating its 10th anniversary in 2025,<strong> </strong>brings some of the world\u2019s best teachers and yogis to the heights, with outdoor sessions, sunrise meditation, Alpine pasture hikes, talks and workshops. Run by passionate mountain lovers, <a href=\"https://www.piltriquitron.com/\">Piltriquitron</a> (doubles from \u00a3113 B&amp;B) is a stylish, welcoming lodge in the heart of St Anton.</p> <h2><strong>Wild swimming</strong><strong>, wildlife and camping in Wales</strong><strong> </strong></h2>    <p>Come summer, conga lines of hikers trot up Wales\u2019 highest peak, 1,085-metre <a href=\"https://eryri.gov.wales/visit/snowdon/\">Yr Wyddfa</a> (Snowdon).

    "full_text": "Hiking and delicious food in Italy\u2019s Monti Sibillini national park\n\nAll Italians race to la spiaggia in summer, leaving the hinterland marvellously empty. Tuscany gets a lot of love, but travel one region over to Umbria and Monti Sibillini national park bewitches with views of the Apennines and eyrie-like, honey-coloured hill towns such as Castelluccio, soaring above a plateau of brightly coloured poppies, cornflowers and daisies. It\u2019s a gorgeous spot for hiking, biking and tracking down a trattoria to dig into specialities such as wild boar with locally grown lentils. You\u2019ll find some of Italy\u2019s finest salami in butcher shops in Norcia, as well as black truffles on the menus of restaurants such as the Michelin-starred Vespasia, which is in a 16th-century palazzo. Alternatively, you could join a tartufaio and their dog to head into the woods on a truffle-hunting tour.\n\nHow to do it Organic farm Agriturismo Casale nel Parco dei Monti Sibillini (doubles from \u00a384 B&B) has truffles and wild herbs in its grounds, and a terrific restaurant serving up local and homegrown produce.\n\nMountain biking and Munros in Scotland\n\nView image in fullscreen The Cairngorms. Photograph: Westend61/Getty Images\n\nIf you take rugged Highland scenery and turn the volume up, you get the Cairngorms national park, a 1,748 square mile expanse of lochs, glens, forests and Munros. Providing the weather behaves, you\u2019ll be itching to get outdoors, whether climbing 1,245-metre (4,085ft) Cairn Gorm or 1,309-metre Ben Macdui, spotting capercaillie, red squirrels and ospreys in the Caledonian pine forest of Rothiemurchus Estate, or meeting the region\u2019s free-roaming reindeer on a hill trip. There are wild swimming spots such as remote Loch Coire an Lochain, and visitors can go biking on Cairngorm Mountain\u2019s slopes. By night, there\u2019s fantastic stargazing in the Cairngorms Dark Sky Park around Tomintoul and Glenlivet.\n\nHow to do it A train from London to Aviemore takes 7-8 hours. It\u2019s free to wild camp in the park. Or stay at a self-catering forest cabin at Cairngorm Lodges (two-nights from \u00a3264) on the park\u2019s eastern fringes.\n\nAlpine lake swimming and high-level hiking in Austria\n\nView image in fullscreen Thiersee near Kufstein has crysal clear water for swimming and paddleboarding. Photograph: Alamy\n\nBetween the Brandenberg Alps and the limestone turrets of the Wilder Kaiser massif, Kufstein is a full-on Alpine fantasy, capped with a medieval fortress. The fact that it\u2019s a living town, rather than a resort, means there\u2019s a great buzz here in summer. And Kufstein\u2019s backyard is beautiful. Within minutes, you can reach Wilder Kaiser\u2019s hiking trails on a single-seat chairlift floating above treetops and meadows to the 1,256-metre peak of Brentenjoch. The landscape is dotted with lakes such as forest\u2011rimmed Hechtsee, mountain\u2011flanked Stimmersee and glass-green Thiersee, where you can dive into some of Austria\u2019s cleanest waters or rent a paddleboard.\n\nHow to do it Kufstein is half an hour from Innsbruck or an hour from Munich by train. Camp by the lakes or stay in town at historic Auracher L\u00f6chl (doubles from \u00a3175 B&B). The local guest pass gives you free use of public transport.\n\nSwitzerland\u2019s only national park is hiking heaven\n\nView image in fullscreen Hikers in the Swiss national park. Photograph: Swiss national park\n\nWith the Alps running across 60% of Switzerland, it\u2019s incredible that this green and lovely land has just one national park. But it\u2019s a good one. Slamming into Italy, the Swiss national park in Graub\u00fcnden\u2019s Engadin valley is an utterly wild Unesco biosphere reserve. Nature has been in charge here since the park\u2019s formation in 1914, and as a result, it\u2019s hiking heaven. The full-day, 13-mile trek from Zernez to Lais da Macun (the Macun lakes) takes in a plateau beaded with 23 Alpine lakes. If you prefer company, sign up for guided ranger walks, including a wildlife-focused one in the Val Trupchun where, with luck and binoculars, you might spot marmots, ibex, chamois, deer and bearded vultures.\n\nHow to do it With good rail connections, Zernez is the gateway to the park and home to the visitor centre. Guided ranger hikes cost about \u00a336. For an off-grid sleep, book Chamanna Cluozza (dorm beds \u00a364). Deep in a forest, the hut is a 3\u00bd-hour hike from Zernez. Bring your sleeping bag.\n\nCycling around Lake Constance \u2013 and through three countries\n\nView image in fullscreen Bregenz in Austria, on the shore of Lake Constance. Photograph: Image Professionals/Alamy\n\nFor uplifting views of the Alps by bike without the uphill slog, Lake Constance is unbeatable. Central Europe\u2019s third largest lake, it delivers a massive shot of everything that makes Europe great \u2013 Roman ruins, medieval castles, gardens, gorges, wetlands, vineyards, orchards, thermal baths and beaches where you can strip off sweaty Lycra for a quick swim or a night spent camping under the stars. Looping around the lake and taking about a week to complete, the 170-mile (273km) Lake Constance Cycle Path, or Bodensee-Radweg as it\u2019s known locally, is the biggie, rolling through three countries: Germany, Austria and Switzerland.\n\nHow to do it Avoid the midsummer madness of July and August for fewer crowds. Bikes and ebikes can be rented in towns fringing the lake. Konstanz in Germany is a great springboard, with good rail connections.\n\nTurquoise lakes and Europe\u2019s biggest ice cap in Norway\n\nView image in fullscreen Camp by Lake Lovatnet in Norway and trek on a glacier. Photograph: Dibrova/Getty Images\n\nMother nature had a wild time in Jostedalsbreen national park in western Norway, delivering a visual feast of mountain-flanked fjords, ice-blue glacial lakes and \u2013 the clincher \u2013 the 37-mile-long Jostedalsbreen, mainland Europe\u2019s biggest ice cap. Ways to explore are many and varied \u2013 there\u2019s an easy four-mile round trek past waterfall-wisped peaks to Briksdalsbreen, an offshoot of the mighty glacier, or an opportunity to kayak, canoe and paddleboard across the turquoise waters of Lovatnet Lake, with rock walls punching above. For a close encounter with the ice, slip on a helmet and crampons to trek across the Haugabreen arm of the glacier.\n\nHow to do it On the dreamy shores of Lovatnet Lake, Sande Camping (pitches from \u00a318) is a crazily pretty spot to pitch a tent. Breogfjell Mountain Guides run six-hour guided glacier walks (\u00a384) from mid-June to August.\n\nSwimming and kayaking in the Julian Alps in Slovenia\n\nView image in fullscreen Lake Bohinj in Slovenia. Photograph: Getty Images\n\nIf you think Lake Bled is ridiculously lovely, wait until you clap eyes on Lake Bohinj, tucked away in the Julian Alps that tear across Triglav national park in Slovenia\u2019s north-west. Here, limestone turrets and pinnacles rise like natural fortifications above forests and glacial lakes that chart the spectrum of blues and greens. Loveliest of the lot is mirror-like Lake Bohinj, where you can dive into jewel-coloured waters that reach 22C in summer. The pebble beach in Ukanc, on the lake\u2019s western shore, is as lovely a spot as any. Arrive early in the morning and you\u2019ll have it all to yourself as you swim, canoe, kayak or paddleboard in glassy waters.\n\nHow to do it Pitch a tent on the shore at eco-friendly Camp Bohinj (pitches from \u00a325). At the boathouse, Pac Sport rents out paddleboards, canoes, kayaks and wooden rowboats.\n\nA long-distance trek in the Dolomites in Italy\n\nView image in fullscreen Alta Via 1 in the Dolomites. Photograph: Alex Ramsay/Alamy\n\nIn the fiery blush of a summer sunset, the Dolomites are at their most entrancing, as the gold-pink light burnishes their buttresses, pinnacles and great fangs of rock. You can admire them from below, but you\u2019ll get much closer on the 75-mile Alta Via 1, one of Italy\u2019s most memorable hikes, reaching from Dobbiaco in the north to Belluno in the south. Negotiating steep, rocky inclines is rewarded with sublime views and stays at rustic huts like Rifugio Lagazuoi and Rifugio Cinque Torri, where you can dig into local specialities like polenta, venison and canederli (bread dumplings with speck and cheese), peer up at star-blanketed night skies and get a crack\u2011of-dawn start on the trail.\n\nHow to do it While the walk is certainly doable alone (book huts ahead for summer and get hold of Cicerone\u2019s Alta Via 1 guide), logistically it\u2019s easier to join a tour, such as the 10-night trip offered by Alpine Exploratory (from \u00a32,880 guided, \u00a31,790 self-guided).\n\nCastle-hopping in Germany\u2019s Bavarian Alps\n\nView image in fullscreen Schloss Neuschwanstein was the inspiration for Disney\u2019s Sleeping Beauty castle. Photograph: Robert Wyatt/Alamy\n\nWhere the Bavarian Alps muscle their way into Austria, F\u00fcssen looks like something out of a children\u2019s story. The old town\u2019s alleys are stacked with gabled, frescoed houses and cafe-lined squares, and lofty castles bear the fantastical imprint of \u201cMad\u201d King Ludwig II (1845-1886). Mad or not, he had an eye for a winning location, which you\u2019ll appreciate when you visit the riotously turreted and recently revamped Schloss Neuschwanstein, which was the blueprint for Disney\u2019s Sleeping Beauty castle, and medieval Hohenschwangau, where little Ludwig grew up. There\u2019s hiking, cycling and swimming at the lakes around F\u00fcssen, such as Forggensee, Hopfensee and Alpsee. All can be reached by bus for free with the local F\u00fcssen Card.\n\nHow to do it F\u00fcssen is two hours from Munich by bus and train (bahn.de). Take your pick of hotels and B&Bs in the town, such as Hotel Sonne (doubles from \u00a3130 B&B) in the historic centre, or camp by one of the lakes.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to The Traveller Free newsletter Get travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian Holidays Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Everyone raves about winter skiing in this chalet-lined village, but there\u2019s lots happening in summer, when the steep slopes are given over to one of the world\u2019s biggest bike parks \u2013 400 miles (650km) of single tracks and heart-racing downhill trails. An extensive network of bike-friendly lifts links them up nicely. If you\u2019re up for a bone-rattling challenge, tackle the Noire de Morzine from the Le Pl\u00e9ney cable car station. After you\u2019ve stripped off sweaty Lycra and body armour, cool off with a swim in one of the crystal-clear lakes on Morzine\u2019s doorstep, such as mountain\u2011clasped Lac de Montriond or forest-rimmed Mines d\u2019Or. You can reach both within minutes on the free village buses.\n\nHow to do it Alpy Transfers runs regular coaches between Geneva airport and Morzine (2 hours, one-way \u00a317), prebooking is essential. Morzine\u2019s Multi Pass gets you access to lifts, lakes and lidos for \u00a32.50 a day. For a rustic-chic place to sleep, check into Jardin Secret (doubles from \u00a3115) in Montriond, a self-catering micro-lodge with a sun terrace, hot tub and easy access to both slopes and lakes.\n\nWalking in Spain\u2019s wild Picos de Europa\n\nView image in fullscreen A mountain shelter in the Picos de Europa. Photograph: Daniel Vi\u00f1\u00e9 Garcia/Getty Images\n\nSpain is at its most ravishing in the 250-square-mile Picos de Europa national park in the Cantabrian mountains of the north. Here you can hike among jagged, lake-splashed peaks, ancient oak and beech forests, and deep, wildflower-flecked valleys where it\u2019s silent enough to hear your own heartbeat \u2013 or perhaps the cry of a golden eagle. The untamed terrain here is best explored with a guide. For a deep dive, Much Better Adventures arranges a challenging hut-to-hut trek, ticking off highs such as the glacial Lakes of Covadonga, the 2,319-metre summit of La Padiorna and the sheer-walled Cares Gorge.\n\nHow to do it Much Better Adventures\u2019 six-night, small-group trek costs from \u00a3875 per person, including local guides, breakfast, dinner and stays in mountain huts and rural guesthouses.\n\nWaterfalls, springs and caves at Plitvice Lakes in Croatia\n\nView image in fullscreen Plitvice Lakes is a Unesco World Heritage site. Photograph: Sorin Colac/Alamy\n\nMost people who head to Croatia dash straight to the coast, but a step back from the Adriatic is the Unesco World Heritage site Plitvice Lakes national park. Against the backdrop of the karstic Dinaric Alps, the park has mineral-rich springs, cascading falls, caves and lakes that glitter jade, aquamarine, ink-blue and turquoise. Brown bears, wild boar, lynx and wolves prowl the old-growth beech and fir forests, and clouds of blue-winged butterflies bring a fairytale touch in summer. For a true flavour of the park, bring binoculars and follow the 11-mile Route K, a full-day hike that knits together all 16 of the lakes.\n\nHow to do it From Zagreb, buses and FlixBus coaches run frequently to Plitvi\u010dka Jezera in just over two hours. There are lots of traditional stone-and-wood villas where you can spend the night, including Villa Verde (doubles from \u00a393 B&B).\n\nA front-row view of the Eiger in Switzerland\n\nView image in fullscreen The Eiger Express cable car. Photograph: David Birri/Jungfraubahnen\n\nSwitzerland\u2019s outrageously beautiful Jungfrau region is the Alps on steroids, with its crashing waterfalls, gemstone lakes, cliff-hugging villages and the glacier-capped big three of the Eiger, M\u00f6nch and Jungfrau looming above it all. You could base yourself anywhere in these heights and reach the summits within minutes on vintage railways and state-of-the-art cable cars \u2013 but Grindelwald has the edge for outdoor adventure. As lively in summer as winter, the village has front-row views of the Eiger\u2019s mile-high north face. The Eiger Express cable car links up to Eigergletscher, the trailhead for the astoundingly scenic, two-hour Eiger Trail. Or you can thunder towards the Eiger on ziplines, mountain carts and chunky scooters called Trottibikes from the First cable car station above Grindelwald.\n\nHow to do it Grindelwald is well connected by rail and can be reached in around nine hours from London via Paris, Strasbourg, Basel and Interlaken. Hotels are pricey, but you can save by camping at riverside Gletscherdorf (pitches from \u00a336).\n\nPractise yoga among Austria\u2019s Alpine peaks\n\nView image in fullscreen St Anton am Arlberg has plenty to offer in summer too. Photograph: Cristian Mihaila/Alamy\n\nSky-scraping peaks, scary slopes and apr\u00e8s-ski parties draw folk to St Anton am Arlberg in Tyrol in winter. But when the snow melts, the village reveals its mellower side, with trails skipping through flower-freckled pastures to Alpine dairy huts like Putzen Alpe, where you can sample a brettljause (sharing board) of local ham and cheese, and watch the bell-swinging cows come home in the honeyed light of late afternoon. If you want to zone out even more from the rush of daily life, St Anton is right up there with the best places in the Alps for a spot of peak-gazing while doing yoga. Pick a meadow to practise your positions or sign up for classes and retreats at Arlflow.\n\nHow to do it St Anton is an hour from Innsbruck by train. In early September, the four-day Mountain Yoga Festival, celebrating its 10th anniversary in 2025, brings some of the world\u2019s best teachers and yogis to the heights, with outdoor sessions, sunrise meditation, Alpine pasture hikes, talks and workshops. Run by passionate mountain lovers, Piltriquitron (doubles from \u00a3113 B&B) is a stylish, welcoming lodge in the heart of St Anton.\n\nWild swimming, wildlife and camping in Wales\n\nView image in fullscreen The Mawddach estuary and the Cadair Idris range. Photograph: Tony Boydon/Alamy\n\nCome summer, conga lines of hikers trot up Wales\u2019 highest peak, 1,085-metre Yr Wyddfa (Snowdon). If you would prefer to give them the slip, head south to Cefn Coed, a 17th-century, off-grid Welsh farm estate embedded in a wooded valley, where the slopes of Cadair Idris roll down to the shifting sands of the Mawddach estuary. It\u2019s all about embracing the wild side of Eryri (Snowdonia) here, whether you\u2019re striking out on foot on the nine-mile Mawddach Trail, which follows an old slate railway track, practising yoga in nature, going wildlife tracking or foraging for edibles you can transform into pickles, powders and pestos. Find your own wild swim spots along the river by day, and go on a starlit walk across the estate to look out for owls, badgers and, on mid-summer nights, glow-worms.\n\nHow to do it Cambrian Line trains stop in Barmouth, four miles from Cefn Coed, where you can camp in a clearing in oak woods (pitches \u00a325-35), or for bigger groups there\u2019s a 12-bed bunkhouse in the farm\u2019s original dairy and bakehouse (two-night stays from \u00a3350).",

Tuscany gets a lot of love, but travel one region over to Umbria and Monti Sibillini national park bewitches with views of the Apennines and eyrie-like, honey-coloured hill towns such as Castelluccio, soaring above a plateau of brightly coloured poppies, cornflowers and daisies. It\u2019s a gorgeous spot for hiking, biking and tracking down a trattoria to dig into specialities such as wild boar with locally grown lentils. You\u2019ll find some of Italy\u2019s finest salami in butcher shops in Norcia, as well as black truffles on the menus of restaurants such as the Michelin-starred Vespasia, which is in a 16th-century palazzo. Alternatively, you could join a tartufaio and their dog to head into the woods on a truffle-hunting tour.\n\nHow to do it Organic farm Agriturismo Casale nel Parco dei Monti Sibillini (doubles from \u00a384 B&B) has truffles and wild herbs in its grounds, and a terrific restaurant serving up local and homegrown produce.\n\nMountain biking and Munros in Scotland\n\nView image in fullscreen The Cairngorms.

Providing the weather behaves, you\u2019ll be itching to get outdoors, whether climbing 1,245-metre (4,085ft) Cairn Gorm or 1,309-metre Ben Macdui, spotting capercaillie, red squirrels and ospreys in the Caledonian pine forest of Rothiemurchus Estate, or meeting the region\u2019s free-roaming reindeer on a hill trip. There are wild swimming spots such as remote Loch Coire an Lochain, and visitors can go biking on Cairngorm Mountain\u2019s slopes. By night, there\u2019s fantastic stargazing in the Cairngorms Dark Sky Park around Tomintoul and Glenlivet.\n\nHow to do it A train from London to Aviemore takes 7-8 hours. It\u2019s free to wild camp in the park. Or stay at a self-catering forest cabin at Cairngorm Lodges (two-nights from \u00a3264) on the park\u2019s eastern fringes.\n\nAlpine lake swimming and high-level hiking in Austria\n\nView image in fullscreen Thiersee near Kufstein has crysal clear water for swimming and paddleboarding.

The fact that it\u2019s a living town, rather than a resort, means there\u2019s a great buzz here in summer. And Kufstein\u2019s backyard is beautiful. Within minutes, you can reach Wilder Kaiser\u2019s hiking trails on a single-seat chairlift floating above treetops and meadows to the 1,256-metre peak of Brentenjoch. The landscape is dotted with lakes such as forest\u2011rimmed Hechtsee, mountain\u2011flanked Stimmersee and glass-green Thiersee, where you can dive into some of Austria\u2019s cleanest waters or rent a paddleboard.\n\nHow to do it Kufstein is half an hour from Innsbruck or an hour from Munich by train.

Nature has been in charge here since the park\u2019s formation in 1914, and as a result, it\u2019s hiking heaven. The full-day, 13-mile trek from Zernez to Lais da Macun (the Macun lakes) takes in a plateau beaded with 23 Alpine lakes. If you prefer company, sign up for guided ranger walks, including a wildlife-focused one in the Val Trupchun where, with luck and binoculars, you might spot marmots, ibex, chamois, deer and bearded vultures.\n\nHow to do it With good rail connections, Zernez is the gateway to the park and home to the visitor centre. Guided ranger hikes cost about \u00a336. For an off-grid sleep, book Chamanna Cluozza (dorm beds \u00a364). Deep in a forest, the hut is a 3\u00bd-hour hike from Zernez.

For a deep dive, Much Better Adventures arranges a challenging hut-to-hut trek, ticking off highs such as the glacial Lakes of Covadonga, the 2,319-metre summit of La Padiorna and the sheer-walled Cares Gorge.\n\nHow to do it Much Better Adventures\u2019 six-night, small-group trek costs from \u00a3875 per person, including local guides, breakfast, dinner and stays in mountain huts and rural guesthouses.\n\nWaterfalls, springs and caves at Plitvice Lakes in Croatia\n\nView image in fullscreen Plitvice Lakes is a Unesco World Heritage site. Photograph: Sorin Colac/Alamy\n\nMost people who head to Croatia dash straight to the coast, but a step back from the Adriatic is the Unesco World Heritage site Plitvice Lakes national park. Against the backdrop of the karstic Dinaric Alps, the park has mineral-rich springs, cascading falls, caves and lakes that glitter jade, aquamarine, ink-blue and turquoise. Brown bears, wild boar, lynx and wolves prowl the old-growth beech and fir forests, and clouds of blue-winged butterflies bring a fairytale touch in summer. For a true flavour of the park, bring binoculars and follow the 11-mile Route K, a full-day hike that knits together all 16 of the lakes.\n\nHow to do it From Zagreb, buses and FlixBus coaches run frequently to Plitvi\u010dka Jezera in just over two hours. There are lots of traditional stone-and-wood villas where you can spend the night, including Villa Verde (doubles from \u00a393 B&B).\n\nA front-row view of the Eiger in Switzerland\n\nView image in fullscreen The Eiger Express cable car. Photograph: David Birri/Jungfraubahnen\n\nSwitzerland\u2019s outrageously beautiful Jungfrau region is the Alps on steroids, with its crashing waterfalls, gemstone lakes, cliff-hugging villages and the glacier-capped big three of the Eiger, M\u00f6nch and Jungfrau looming above it all. You could base yourself anywhere in these heights and reach the summits within minutes on vintage railways and state-of-the-art cable cars \u2013 but Grindelwald has the edge for outdoor adventure. As lively in summer as winter, the village has front-row views of the Eiger\u2019s mile-high north face. The Eiger Express cable car links up to Eigergletscher, the trailhead for the astoundingly scenic, two-hour Eiger Trail. Or you can thunder towards the Eiger on ziplines, mountain carts and chunky scooters called Trottibikes from the First cable car station above Grindelwald.\n\nHow to do it Grindelwald is well connected by rail and can be reached in around nine hours from London via Paris, Strasbourg, Basel and Interlaken. Hotels are pricey, but you can save by camping at riverside Gletscherdorf (pitches from \u00a336).\n\nPractise yoga among Austria\u2019s Alpine peaks\n\nView image in fullscreen St Anton am Arlberg has plenty to offer in summer too. Photograph: Cristian Mihaila/Alamy\n\nSky-scraping peaks, scary slopes and apr\u00e8s-ski parties draw folk to St Anton am Arlberg in Tyrol in winter. But when the snow melts, the village reveals its mellower side, with trails skipping through flower-freckled pastures to Alpine dairy huts like Putzen Alpe, where you can sample a brettljause (sharing board) of local ham and cheese, and watch the bell-swinging cows come home in the honeyed light of late afternoon. If you want to zone out even more from the rush of daily life, St Anton is right up there with the best places in the Alps for a spot of peak-gazing while doing yoga. Pick a meadow to practise your positions or sign up for classes and retreats at Arlflow.\n\nHow to do it St Anton is an hour from Innsbruck by train. In early September, the four-day Mountain Yoga Festival, celebrating its 10th anniversary in 2025, brings some of the world\u2019s best teachers and yogis to the heights, with outdoor sessions, sunrise meditation, Alpine pasture hikes, talks and workshops. Run by passionate mountain lovers, Piltriquitron (doubles from \u00a3113 B&B) is a stylish, welcoming lodge in the heart of St Anton.\n\nWild swimming, wildlife and camping in Wales\n\nView image in fullscreen The Mawddach estuary and the Cadair Idris range. Photograph: Tony Boydon/Alamy\n\nCome summer, conga lines of hikers trot up Wales\u2019 highest peak, 1,085-metre Yr Wyddfa (Snowdon). If you would prefer to give them the slip, head south to Cefn Coed, a 17th-century, off-grid Welsh farm estate embedded in a wooded valley, where the slopes of Cadair Idris roll down to the shifting sands of the Mawddach estuary. It\u2019s all about embracing the wild side of Eryri (Snowdonia) here, whether you\u2019re striking out on foot on the nine-mile Mawddach Trail, which follows an old slate railway track, practising yoga in nature, going wildlife tracking or foraging for edibles you can transform into pickles, powders and pestos. Find your own wild swim spots along the river by day, and go on a starlit walk across the estate to look out for owls, badgers and, on mid-summer nights, glow-worms.\n\nHow to do it Cambrian Line trains stop in Barmouth, four miles from Cefn Coed, where you can camp in a clearing in oak woods (pitches \u00a325-35), or for bigger groups there\u2019s a 12-bed bunkhouse in the farm\u2019s original dairy and bakehouse (two-night stays from \u00a3350).",

The light, the landscape (huge boulders, savanna-like landscape with holm oaks dotted around) and sounds of the birds and insects make you feel like you are truly in the middle of nowhere. The couple who run the site are passionate about nature and sustainability. All electricity is from solar, rainwater is collected and the beautiful pool is chemical-free.

    "full_text": "Istrian dreams, Croatia\n\nHaving been cycling across Europe for nearly two months, we\u2019d become campsite connoisseurs. Natura Camp Karli stands out for being a tranquil oasis on the Istrian peninsula in Croatia. We loved pitching our tent in an olive grove, having been welcomed with a gift of handmade products. The facilities were simple, but excellent, with a covered area and stoves for cooking, as well as ample seating with a view. It\u2019s a peaceful location, with the coast about six miles away. After a wonderful night\u2019s sleep, drifting off to the gentle hum of insects, we left with an extra spring in our pedalling.\n\nPitch from \u20ac25\n\nMary\n\nSolar power in Portugal\u2019s Alentejo\n\nView image in fullscreen Swimming pool at Bubulcus & Bolotas in Portugal. Photograph: Lucie\n\nWe only stayed one night at Bubulcus & Bolotas during our Portugal campervan trip last summer, but I will remember it for ever. The light, the landscape (huge boulders, savanna-like landscape with holm oaks dotted around) and sounds of the birds and insects make you feel like you are truly in the middle of nowhere. The couple who run the site are passionate about nature and sustainability. All electricity is from solar, rainwater is collected and the beautiful pool is chemical-free. The best part was the stargazing \u2013 the milky way so clear with the naked eye \u2013 spellbinding. The place is about a two-hour drive east of Lisbon, north of \u00c9vora.\n\nAdult \u20ac6, pitches from \u20ac10\n\nLucie\n\nProfile Readers' tips: send a tip for a chance to win a \u00a3200 voucher for a Coolstays break Show Guardian Travel readers' tips Every week we ask our readers for recommendations from their travels.

Photograph: mauritius images GmbH/Alamy\n\nThe beautiful family-run Inselcamp Unterach on the edge of Attersee in Austria, in the heart of the Salzkammergut lake district, is a serene spot.

With great facilities including an adventure playground, bar and restaurant, and fantastic views of spectacular waterfalls cascading hundreds of feet off the mountains, hikers and families will find it perfectly located. The lovely outdoor Lauterbrunnen swimming pool is a 15-minute walk away. There are easy, moderate and difficult walking routes that set off in every direction up and down mountains and through alpine meadows.\n\nBasic tent pitch from 31.60CHF\n\nKelvin\n\nP\u00e9tanque, seafood and sunsets, France\n\nView image in fullscreen Noirmoutier is all about long beaches, gentle sea and plentiful seafood. Photograph: Arterra Picture Library/Alamy\n\nHuttopia Noirmoutier is our go-to campsite for the first few days of longer campervan breaks around Europe. It\u2019s the perfect place to decompress and ease you into the holiday. Just off the coast of the northern Vend\u00e9e, the island of Noirmoutier is all about long beaches, gentle sea, sun, and plentiful seafood. The local market, about 20 minutes\u2019 cycle along the sea wall from the campsite, is bursting with the freshest possible produce, and the white painted town wouldn\u2019t look out of place on the Mediterranean. The campsite is on the beach \u2013 perfect for days of paddleboarding and swimming \u2013 and the p\u00e9tanque court, pizzas, and bar provide for easy evenings as the sun sets over the sea.\n\nPitch from \u20ac29.50\n\nIain\n\nTents and turtles, Zante, Greece\n\nView image in fullscreen Cameo Island, with its wooden footbridge, is just over two miles from Camping Tartaruga.

Against a backdrop of olive trees and shimmering turquoise waters, the tents have a view of Laganas bay. Snorkelling is wonderful here and loggerhead turtles can sometimes be spotted on the sands.\n\nAdult \u20ac7, pitches from \u20ac5\n\nBill\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to The Traveller Free newsletter Get travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian Holidays Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.
